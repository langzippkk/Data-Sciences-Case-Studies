1196,8.04E+11,14.4," genuine width this time, but he has protection on the cover point boundary to keep that flat-batted slap down to a -999",10
1197,8.04E+11,14.3," fullish, just wide enough of off stump to give joyce room to swing his arms through and loft down the ground, over mid-off",10

1217,8.04E+11,5.1," ooh. he wasn't fully forward to this -999, which threatened to shape -999 but didn't swing as much as the batsman expected. pushed -999 from his body and inside-edged it onto his front pad",1
1218,8.04E+11,40.6, extra bounce from dawlat and breaks haq's bat! and they say these things are monstrous! it's a back of a length delivery on off stump which he tries to block and is surprised by it rearing up at him. uses soft hands to run it towards slip and gets another shock as he realises a good chunk of his bat is gone,2

1220,8.04E+11,40.4, back of a length on off stump and raises a huge clunk off the bat as it thuds into the full face,2
1221,8.04E+11,40.3, seeks a yorker just outside off and almost finds it. evans is good enough to run it down to third man and get across to the other end,2

1225,8.04E+11,36.5," fuller delivery cuts back in at the batsman this time, hits the pad and wanders to midwicket",1
1226,8.04E+11,36.4, and he delivers! signals to the fans on the grass banks after trapping berrington with the -999 that goes -999. a set up as good as any bowler from the major nations. good length ball brings him forward and hard hands jab at the ball. the outside edge is taken and zazai is impregnable behind the stumps. dives to his right and picks up a good low catch,1

1228,8.04E+11,36.2," whoa! how did that leap over the stumps?! it was a fuller delivery, it ducked back in at berrington. he was too late on trying to bring his bat in line with the swing and is very lucky to have the ball lob his stumps. can only flash a little smile and say you were too good for me there, dawlat",1

1232,8.04E+11,32.5," hamid doesn't need to be bowling to pull off an outrageous celebration! raced in from mid-off, dives forward and picks up a lovely catch to dismiss davey. poor shot - a drive on the up to a fuller delivery outside off - especially considering afghanistan had brought shapoor back for the express purpose of wickets. and the celebration - hamid spreads his hands wide with just as wide a smile and tries to roll back and over his head. doesn't quite succeed though",0

1244,8.04E+11,15.5," good length ball on off stump, defended",5
1245,8.04E+11,15.4, fuller and so it swings in at the batsman as well. mommsen is forward with a solid defensive push,5

1247,8.04E+11,15.2," back of a good length on off stump, eased to third man with the angled bat again. and machan scrapes some grass off his boots after running down the side of the pitch",5
1248,8.04E+11,15.1," a bit too full and he couples it with some handy width too. all machan had to do was pierce the gap behind point, and he does so with a lovely open face. skips -999 to the short boundary",5

1257,8.04E+11,4.4," sees width, sees red, flays his bat and is beaten. just enough bounce off the deck for the shortish ball to beat coetzer's cut",5
1258,8.04E+11,4.3, walks across outside off - telegraphed it - so shapoor digs in his 135 kph delivery. gardiner makes the adjustment and tucks it off his hips,5

1263,8.04E+11,2.4," that's how you cut! sit back in the crease, flay your arms at the ball and also make sure to roll your wrists. coetzer uses the bowler's pace and make him pay for going short and wide",5

1270,8.04E+11,0.3, almost falls over after delivering a fuller length and demanding the ball to nip back in at the batsman this time. coetzer is a bit uncomfortable again as he hops and blocks,1
1271,8.04E+11,0.2," shortish and skirting outside off, coetzer jumps back in his crease nervously and blocks",1
1272,8.04E+11,0.1," back of a length, with a bit of nip -999 as was expected. coetzer is a bit squared up and nudges it towards point",1
1273,8.04E+11,49.3," he's done it! shapoor has the vicroty and races off to -999 corner of the ground in his trademark celebration. the scots are heartbroken, shenwari is delirously happy! he wanted a yorker, ends up with a low full toss on leg stump and it's been picked off. shapoor had stopped running as soon as the ball beat the short fine leg fielder. spread his hands -999 wide and fell onto the turn in joy! what a match! what a performance! what theatre! this is how good the world cup can be! this is how good it should be!",5
1274,8.04E+11,49.2," slower ball ball on middle and leg, shapoor nudges it into the leg side and sets off. there's no -999 there though and machan bounds in and delivers an underarm throw, but it misses its mark! whoooa, the tension is getting to me!! time for a break for shapoor as he gets some magic spray on his left hand",5
1275,8.04E+11,49.1," curling yorker on off stump and it gets a thick outside edge to deep third man. hamid did very well to protect his stumps. they're nailing their death overs discipline here, both teams",5

1280,8.04E+11,44.2," waits on middle and leg and turns it to short fine leg, but shenwari has raced down to the middle of the pitch and seemed stranded. the throw comes to the right and - the bowler's - but haq, like his bowling, takes an age to break the stumps. went for a loopy arc around the stumps instead of just jabbing to his right side after collecting the ball. safe. pressure showing badly on scotland now",2
1281,8.04E+11,44.1," good length ball on off stump, hamid employs that late dab again but this time there was a short third man and shenwari points him -999 after saying no. good call from the senior batsman",2

3005,8.04E+11,47.3," another leading edge, squirts -999 to the off side",10
3006,8.04E+11,47.3," top bowling from seelaar here. bopara running down the -999 and it was fired flat and down the leg side, would have been a stunning take but technically a missed stumping -999 suppose",10
3007,8.04E+11,47.2," excellent work from collingwood, stands tall to sort of reverse-tap this, took it from well outside leg and almost sent it down to the third man rope, really well timed",10
3008,8.04E+11,47.1, boot saves -999 here! bopara nailed a straight drive and seelaar shoved -999 a left foot to save the boundary,10
3009,8.04E+11,43.6," collingwood is less wristy but he leg-side bunt is even more effective here, collecting a couple to deep square. bukhari, needless to say, was too far down the leg side",8
3010,8.04E+11,43.5," bukhari can't seem to get the ball on off stump, again he slides down leg and with a flick of the wrists, bopara is off the mark",8
3011,8.04E+11,43.4, this keeps a touch low and bopara is rooted to the crease. plays around his front pad in defence,8
3012,8.04E+11,43.3, again this is mistimed off the inside half of the bat but a -999 will do england well enough,8
3013,8.04E+11,43.2," wrong line from bukhari and precious runs for england. full and sliding down leg, collingwood only needs his favourite inside edge and it speeds -999 to the rope",8
3014,8.04E+11,43.1," shortish delivery that collingwood aims a heave at, his form is still some way from vintage and it dribbles off an inside edge",8
3015,8.04E+11,40.6," oops, misfield at cover means bell's gentle drive earns a -999 it shouldn't have",6
3016,8.04E+11,40.5, vintage collingwood! nudged -999 to leg,6
3017,8.04E+11,40.4, collingwood aims a back-foot drive and mistimes it horridly and it barely dribbles off his blade,6
3018,8.04E+11,40.3," bell picks off a -999, working past midwicket",6
3019,8.04E+11,40.2," starts well enough, getting back in his crease to work to leg",6
3020,8.04E+11,40.2," -999, wow! that is an absolute stunner from barresi! so sharp! trott aimed to flick a delivery that was sliding down the leg side, overbalanced and before he could even think about what had happened, barresi had the bails off. it was a wide too, remarkable stuff",6
3021,8.04E+11,40.1," very wide delivery to start, a long way outside off, bell stretched and stretched to just about toe-end this, fetching it to mid-on. cricket at it's finest there",6
3022,8.04E+11,37.6, worked -999 -999 to deep midwicket,7
3023,8.04E+11,37.5, tossed up and comes -999 as a juicy full toss...should have gone for -999 but instead it's a couple wide of long-on to take trott to another -999-day fifty,7
3024,8.04E+11,37.4, gives himself a touch of room and drives off the back foot through cover,7
3025,8.04E+11,37.3," well, plenty happened that ball...there was a big appeal for lbw but it was sliding down leg, then the ball was thrown in at hit the stumps and bounced -999 for a -999",7
3026,8.04E+11,37.2, goes for a reverse sweep but only gets a bottom edge into his pad which dribbles -999,7
3027,8.04E+11,37.1," driven down the on side, the bowler dives but helps it -999 for a run",7
3028,8.04E+11,29.6," touch too wide allows bell to get off the mark, cutting down to third man",3
3029,8.04E+11,29.5, bell gets forward to drive his first ball stylishly to mid-off,3
3030,8.04E+11,29.4," no alarm this time, just a routine -999 worked into the leg side",3
3031,8.04E+11,29.3, trott gets a grubber and he's hanging on the back foot. causes all sorts of ooohs and aaahs,3
3032,8.04E+11,29.2," the change of bowling does the trick! strauss, inexplicably, tried to smack this pull shot -999 the ground and got under it too much, ended up spooning down towards the square leg boundary where cooper hared in to take the catch. good innings from strauss but ends short of hundred",3
3033,8.04E+11,29.1, new bowler looks much the same sort of package as the last and trott pushes a -999 to cover,3
3034,8.04E+11,26.6, decent lines from ten doeschate but no great threat and trott cruises another -999 to long-on. half way to their target now,6
3035,8.04E+11,26.5, fullish and driven down the ground for another milky -999,6
3036,8.04E+11,26.4, for once strauss mistimes a cut shot and it dribbles -999 to point,6
3037,8.04E+11,26.3," england look for -999 and trott clips down to fine leg, but only -999 available",6
3038,8.04E+11,26.2, trott leans forward and clips a couple to deep midwicket,6
3039,8.04E+11,26.1, touch leg side from rtd and it's turned around the corner,6
3040,8.04E+11,23.6, given a chance to -999 the shot strauss clears the point fielder this time to pinch the strike,6
3041,8.04E+11,23.5, this is a touch shorter and the cut shot finds point,6
3042,8.04E+11,23.4," high-quality milking from strauss, opening the face to find a gap at deep cover and running swiftly to turn -999 into -999",6
3043,8.04E+11,23.3, trott this time rotates the strike by fiddling into the leg side,6
3044,8.04E+11,23.2, too short here and strauss rocks back to cut to deep point. ambles a -999,6
3045,8.04E+11,23.1," tossed-up offspin, trott watches it onto the face of the bat and pushes a -999 to long-on",6

3050,8.04E+11,13.2, not much bounce and it's worked -999 to midwicket,2

3052,8.04E+11,11.6," same line, same shot, same result...another freebie boundary for strauss who has looked in fine touch. turns his wrists and sends it racing to deep square",9
3053,8.04E+11,11.5," poor line outside leg stump, easy pickings for strauss as he flicks it past short fine-leg...the captain continues to score at well in excess of a run-a-ball",9
3054,8.04E+11,11.4, comes across the crease and flicks this from middle and off -999 to midwicket,9
3055,8.04E+11,11.3," slower ball on leg stump, gets to pietersen on the full and he flicks it -999 to deep square",9

3063,8.04E+11,9.1," outside off, no stroke offered",1
3064,8.04E+11,6.6, bosh. strauss's determination to hang back in the crease pays dividends as bukhari drops short. well pulled through midwicket,6
3065,8.04E+11,6.5," red-bull run! the fielder was back on the edge of the circle, so pietersen sprinted an instant -999 to mid-off. made it in time",6
3066,8.04E+11,6.4," driven hard, back to the bowler. kp is hitting the field a lot in his innings so far...",6

3071,8.04E+11,44.6," otieno has lost it completely, serves up a very high full toss way outside off stump, and it is clattered over the infield effortlessly",20
3072,8.04E+11,44.5," this is superb batting from umar, he had backed -999 far outside leg, was surprised initially with the slower -999 that tucked him up, but played a late steer past short third man",20
3073,8.04E+11,44.4," poor bowling this is, high full toss outside off stump, and bashed -999 over extra cover, flat-batted, and it went fast and flat",20
3074,8.04E+11,44.3," another boundary, gets a short -999 outside off stump, waits for an instant to get the cut in the gap between point and cover",20

3304,8.04E+11,9.1," lovely pull from ryder. couple of things to watch in that shot. it was short from johnson yes, but ryder had to place it in front of square, since there was david hussey at deep backward square leg. secondly, he had to ensure he did not top edge it. ryder did both, placing it in front of square, and rolling the wrists expertly over it, almost like he was playing a top-spin forehand at ping pong. beats hussey's dive and makes it to the fence",9

3561,8.04E+11,4.3," slow offcutter from shoaib - at 130 kph. yes, -999 know thats faster than many fast bowlers' fastest balls, but well. tharanga stays on the crease and drops it to the off side",3
3562,8.04E+11,4.2," short of a length and just outside off, too close for the cut and not short enough either. tharanga gets a bottom edge -999 to the slips. good start this, from pakistan.",3
3563,8.04E+11,4.1," shoaib pumps it in, back of a length and targeting dilshan's body, he calmly taps it to square leg for -999",3
3564,8.04E+11,2.6," length ball on off stump, tharanga gets into a nice position as he eases the cover drive, and finds the fielder",6
3565,8.04E+11,2.5," whoa, dilshan smashes a cover drive with great vengeance and furious anger (as samuel jackson says, in pulp fiction), and it bursts through afridi. they take a -999 and afridi is wringing his hands in pain after returning the throw",6
3566,8.04E+11,2.4," dilshan's not finding this easy yet. shoaib angles into middle and leg, he looks to whip-hoick behind square but can't make connection",6

3568,8.04E+11,2.2," more assurance from tharanga, leans into a check drive into the covers as shoaib lands it fuller",6
3569,8.04E+11,2.1," pace, pure pace. that clocked at 141 kph, but -999 am sure it came off the track at much greater speed. short ball, hustles tharanga onto the back foot where he dangles the bat, horizontal and in hope as the ball whizzes by, it cracks the outside edge, flies high and nearly carries over third man.",6
3570,8.04E+11,0.6," and he mistimes a drive to the leg side off the last ball. nice bustling over from shoaib, ends with -999 more angling across, back of a length and he gets an inside edge towards midwicket",2
3571,8.04E+11,0.5, beaten by pace and movement. 141 kph as it angles across tharanga who feels for it with feet rooted. missed the ball by a mile.,2

3573,8.04E+11,0.3," 141 kph, back of a length outside off and dilshan has a wild monster swing at it, without moving anything. that came in off the seam. dilshan practices the textbook cover drive after missing. what a guy!",2
3574,8.04E+11,0.2," width outside off this time, tharanga opens the face and steers it -999 to third man",2
3575,8.04E+11,0.1, back of a length on middle at 143 kph. shoaib is chugging -999 already. tharanga hangs back and defends from the crease as it angles across,2

3578,8.04E+11,42.4," short to dhoni this time, he was waiting for it too and after mistiming a couple he's nailed this. almost hacking himself off his feet as he swung this to the rope",15
3579,8.04E+11,42.3, shortish again but this time it's pushed to cover,15
3580,8.04E+11,42.2, we all know it's going to be short and yuvraj certainly does too. he sits back waiting for it and a waist-high bouncer was never going to end prettily for the bowler. thwacked straight of the square leg for -999,15
3581,8.04E+11,42.2," goodness, this was less short than it was very, very wide down the leg side. lucky yuvraj missed it really",15
3582,8.04E+11,42.1," good start from shahzad, back of a length. dhoni, with his new bat seems to force with the bottom hand through cover, which only he could do really",15

3587,8.04E+11,35.2," better from swann, actually hitting the pitch this time and yuvraj can't get it -999",13
3588,8.04E+11,35.1," low full-toss, yuvraj plays the wristiest of whips to pick the ball up and over a leaping collingwood at midwicket. -999 runs, and will that be the shot to open his innings up?",13

3591,8.04E+11,29.4," gone! against the run of play swann has got the breakthrough. it was a good ball, biting into the pitch and spinning past what was another very lazy nurdle from gambhir. it looked like he was trying to get it down to third man, but the feet went nowhere. poor shot, and it's got england back into the game",2
3592,8.04E+11,29.3," full again, swann sticking with the defensive round-the--999 line and he's nudged down the ground for -999",2
3593,8.04E+11,29.2," flicked very fine towards fine leg this time, but the man at 45 scoots across very quickly to cut it off",2
3594,8.04E+11,29.1," swann comes round the -999, and it's a low full toss but tendulkar can't get it -999 as he whips to leg",2
3595,8.04E+11,28.6," past the edge! the last couple of overs have all ended this way ... anderson nibbles -999 -999 from the left-hander, who is flat-footed in the drive and easily beaten. the ball dies off the -999 though, dipping on prior",14
3596,8.04E+11,28.5," another boundary, but this time it's a lucky -999! full again, gambhir launches into a drive and a thick inside edge flies down to fine leg past the stumps. that's his fifty too, good work",14
3597,8.04E+11,28.4," that's the length and the line he should be bowling, anderson goes fuller and much straighter and this time it's just the -999 run",14
3598,8.04E+11,28.3," and again, this time anderson offers up a gift wide of off stump and is duly thrashed square of the -999",14
3599,8.04E+11,28.2," sumptuous driving from tendulkar, on the up and through the covers! technically just about as perfect as you can get, and it even gets past kp's dive on the ropes",14

3601,8.04E+11,21.6," ooh, poked towards short third man. touch uppish and there was almost a mix-up with the running but after all that, no alarm. apart from for the england players",10
3602,8.04E+11,21.5," gambhir does all he needs to, which is work a -999 off the pads. strauss has called a bowling change by the looks of things, this innings is ticking now",10
3603,8.04E+11,21.4, boundary followed up with an opened-face glide to third man. his strike rate is only going -999 way now,10
3604,8.04E+11,21.3," tendulkar likes the look of collingwood and brings his fifty up in style! down the track, clears his front leg and eases his big bat through the line, sending it a long way over the midwicket rope",10
3605,8.04E+11,21.2, this is picked off into space,10
3606,8.04E+11,21.1," crowd erupts as tendulkar edges down menacingly and smashes this, but straight to long-on",10
3607,8.04E+11,19.6, decent over for england ends with gambhir pushing a -999 into a gap at cover,2
3608,8.04E+11,19.5," plenty of air on this, too much so, in fact, as it reaches gambhir on the full. but the batsman only prodded it back down the pitch and collingwood dived smartly to his left",2
3609,8.04E+11,19.4, another offcutter and it's worked carefully into the midwicket region,2
3610,8.04E+11,19.3," ah, good battle here. tendulkar edged down, collingwood fired it wide of off and the batsman had to reach to poke it to point",2

3613,8.04E+11,18.6," tendulkar this time on the walk, edging down and full-facing a middle-overs -999 to long-off. decent start from yardy, not sure tendulkar would be overly worried though",5
3614,8.04E+11,18.5, gambhir walks down the crease and keeps walking through to complete a -999 after milking to long-on,5
3615,8.04E+11,18.4, this time the line drifts a touch towards the pads and a flick of the wrists picks off a -999,5
3616,8.04E+11,18.3," classic yardy! low-arm, slung in, no spin, nothing for tendulkar to work with",5
3617,8.04E+11,18.2, just a touch too short and gambhir is sitting back and uses the width outside off to punch to deep cover,5

3619,8.04E+11,15.6, follows through with that thought this time. he reaches -999 to upper cut it over backward point,6

3632,8.04E+11,6.5," flat-batted whack! the slow pitch played its part in shot selection. it rose from short of length outside off, slower, and sehwag waited. and waited. he then decided to shelve the cut shot and go for a forehand cross court. he whacked it up and over mid-on",11
3633,8.04E+11,6.4," full in length around off, tendulkar taps it towards mid-on and calls for a -999. sehwag responds this time. mike atherton remembers the dhaka run -999 on air.",11

3636,8.04E+11,6.1," whipped! it;s a short of length delivery on the middle, perhaps middle and leg, sehwag stayed back and clipped it to deep square-leg region. shehzad gets across in time but slips as his foot gets struck on the damp outfield and the ball rolls through his grasp.",11

3639,8.04E+11,5.4," high bouncer outside off and tendulkar was caught in -999 minds: whether to sway -999 or play the upper cut. he first started to sway -999, saw the ball was rising slowly, held his balance and tried to upper cut it over vacant slips but no wood on leather",5
3640,8.04E+11,5.3," full in length again, tendulkar gets forward to defend it to the off",5
3641,8.04E+11,5.2, now kevin peitersen goes tumbling down the ground. tendulkar had whipped this full delivery on the pads to deep backward square-leg region where kevin makes an excellent diving stop,5

3666,8.04E+11,24.1, with the field set very deep singles are available all around and strauss gets deep into his crease to punch -999 down to long-on,7
3667,8.04E+11,23.6," nothing risky here just a full-faced bunt, down the ground to take the strike again",7
3668,8.04E+11,23.5, hint of spin almost causes alarm but strauss is careful in defence,7
3669,8.04E+11,23.4, bell this time edges down the pitch and strokes -999 to long-on,7
3670,8.04E+11,23.3, having taken the boundary he can push a -999 into space. crowd rather quiet at the moment,7
3671,8.04E+11,23.2, ah strauss! who said he's not versatile enough for asia? reverse sweeping with indecent ease and sending it rushing to the third man rope,7

3692,8.04E+11,3.5, he was batting so well with the conventional methods. suddenly he is trying to rush down the track and slog and its not working. he again moved down the pitch and tried to heave to the leg side but edges it to his body,2

3883,8.04E+11,43.2," take a bow, lasith malinga, it's a hat-trick, he had got -999 on the last ball of his previous over, homes in on middle stump, nothing can stop it, least of all poor shem ngoche, who was just about expecting this, but could not do anything to stop it, it scorches its way past the gap between bat and pad, the shatterer of stumps has five",5
3884,8.04E+11,43.1," 144 kph yorker, make way, that is headed only -999 way, the middle stump is shaken -999 of its stupor, no chance for the batsman, this is malinga at his lethal best, want yorker, get yorker, on demand, any time",5
3885,8.04E+11,41.6," malinga was trying this when he was firing in those full tosses, gets it right this time, the yorker crashes into the boot, too bad he could not get it -999 of the way, the umpire gave him the finger, but kenya go for the review, malinga is too tight there with the front foot, was it a no-ball, was there some part of the foot behind the landing crease, the ball then moved in late, and would have gone on to just strike leg stump, graze it as it were, the on-field call stands, it's not a no-ball, it is hitting leg, and mishra's misery is over",9
3886,8.04E+11,41.5," another full toss, this -999 is down the leg side, and bounds -999 off the pads behind square",9
3887,8.04E+11,41.4," now he goes down on a knee and looks to go over cow corner, the outside edge takes it very fine on the off side, no chance for any man, not even third man",9
3888,8.04E+11,41.3," low full toss at 143.-999 kph, he gets some bat on it, and it runs -999 wide of mid off, for a boundary, just seemed a prod",9
3889,8.04E+11,41.2," another yorker length ball but this time wide outside off stump, and pushes it -999 to point",9
3890,8.04E+11,41.1," what's that? is it a plane? is it a bird? is it rhodes? no it's chamara silva, a steaming yorker from malinga, just about dug -999 by the batsman, but they make the mistake of attempting the -999, silva runs in from midwicket, picks up the ball, and goes flying in to stumps horizontally at the striker's end, catching the batsman way -999 of his ground, as the replays confirm",9
3891,8.04E+11,39.6," another -999 comes in off the seam, takes mishra by surprise a bit, but he plays it -999 in to the leg side in the end, helps if your mind is just on survival",3
3892,8.04E+11,39.5, remains in the crease to play the incoming delivery towards midwicket,3
3893,8.04E+11,39.4," punched -999 off the back foot, extra cover fields, no power on the shot",3

3895,8.04E+11,39.2," gets to his 50 now, comes forward and slaps a length ball wide of extra cover, and far -999 from sweeper cover too",3
3896,8.04E+11,39.1," manages to dig -999 a yorker on middle stump, a touch easier when its not at malinga's pace",3
3897,8.04E+11,38.6, the shortish length allows him to go back and he plays it back to the bowler,1
3898,8.04E+11,38.5," more tight defence from mishra, can't do anything else with this",1
3899,8.04E+11,38.4, now he stretched well forward in defence,1
3900,8.04E+11,38.3," gets forward and goes for the big drive, mistimes it to mid off",1
3901,8.04E+11,38.2," now the -999 that goes straight on, super stuff from ajantha, he jabs it -999 on the off side awkwardly",1
3902,8.04E+11,38.1," gets it to turn from around off stump, too much for the batsman. he is beaten",1
3903,8.04E+11,32.6," another doosra, they aren't even close to picking it. david sweeps and misses completely.",4
3904,8.04E+11,32.5," tight line on off stump, david manages to get bat on it as he hangs it outside off and looks for the steer. couple to third man",4
3905,8.04E+11,32.4," another leading edge, murali doesn't turn this -999 in either as tikolo shapes to flick and gets it -999 towards mid off after playing the flick",4
3906,8.04E+11,32.3," the doosra fizzes past tikolo's bat, hanging in hope outside off, expecting an offbreak.",4
3907,8.04E+11,32.2," another sweep from david, not controlled and it goes off the top edge down to deep square leg. the fielder inside the circle jumped up, but it was too high for him",4
3908,8.04E+11,32.1," tossed up outside off and straightening, turned off the pads to the leg side",4
3909,8.04E+11,19.6," collins gets -999, full marks for intent and bravery as he chips down the track despite not reading most of the over. he gets far enough to reach the pitch of the ball and then just lofts through the line over wide mid off. no fielders back, and -999 to the cause",6
3910,8.04E+11,19.4," this time he gets it -999 to cover, leaning -999 and pushing a delivery on off stump.",6
3911,8.04E+11,19.3," kumble-esque minimalism from mendis, just enough to get the outside edge of a decent batsman, but collins can't get bat on it as it breaks -999",6
3912,8.04E+11,19.2," the obuyas have added 50 for the first time in their careers. slider on the pads, hurries past the batsman before he can play the pull and -999 for -999 legbyes to fine leg",6
3913,8.04E+11,19.1," a hat-trick of leading edges. back of a length and holding its line, he is down the track and looking to nurdle. the ball goes through mid off.",6
3914,8.04E+11,18.6," well, he's dealing in leading edges here. another tossed up ball on the stumps, another instance of early closing of the bat face, and it runs -999 to point",2
3915,8.04E+11,18.5, perfect placement at the end of it all. murali ekes -999 the leading edge with a flighted ball and it balloons up alarmingly over the bowler's head and in front of mid-on. nearly a run -999 in the end,2
3916,8.04E+11,18.4," whoa, lovely from the wizard, slides a nifty offbreak that doesn't turn as much as usual and whizzes past the prod.",2

3923,8.04E+11,16.3, short ball and a lovely pull shot. shot of a man who has given up legspin to become a full-time batsman. rocks back and swivels the ball on off stump round to midwicket. finds the fielder though. there could have been -999 with better running.,3
3924,8.04E+11,16.2," back of a length outside off, he hangs back in the crease and steers straight to point",3

3926,8.04E+11,4.6," a rarity, a ball hits the middle of the bat, solidly defended towards cover from the crease",8
3927,8.04E+11,4.5," another -999 manages to survive, malinga gets the edge, he went pushing at it from the crease, and it bounced in front of second slip, kenya get -999 this time",8
3928,8.04E+11,4.4," length ball outside off for a change, it is left alone",8
3929,8.04E+11,4.3," in the air, but in the gap, full outside off stump, he went pushing at it from the crease, but it went between cover and point",8

3932,8.04E+11,3.6," and now this -999 goes a bit straighter outside off, and he tries to force it -999 through covers, but gets it to mid off",1
3933,8.04E+11,3.5," pushes forward hopefully to a fuller -999 and gets it off the middle of the bat, and it bounds -999 to extra cover",1
3934,8.04E+11,3.4," now goes wider with the line, a shade outside off stump, but it comes back in sharply, he gets forward and tentatively pushes at it",1
3935,8.04E+11,3.3," another -999 comes in, kenya are all at sea, just about manages to survive",1
3936,8.04E+11,3.2," that came back a long way, this is too good for kenya, he did not know what to do with that, off the pads and towards square leg",1

3938,8.04E+11,11.6," tharanga is looking distinctly scratchy, hurries onto the front foot and then sees the ball is short of a length and angling across him off the deck. he has to adjust quickly and defend to the off side",2
3939,8.04E+11,11.5," fuller length on middle and off, defends from the crease to mid on",2
3940,8.04E+11,11.4," plays all over a length ball angling in from wide of the leg stump, sanga inside edges onto the pads and runs across for a -999",2
3941,8.04E+11,11.3," angled across the batsman, he opens the face and steers to third man for -999",2

3949,8.04E+11,10.1," good fielding from david obuya this time, over-pitched on off stump and driven solidly to the right of david who dives -999 from mid off and stops",8
3950,8.04E+11,1.6," again, interesting inward shape from back of a length outside off and cracked into the covers. cramped for room.",6
3951,8.04E+11,1.5," odhiambo lands this fuller, dilshan is reluctant to come forward and check drives down the ground",6
3952,8.04E+11,1.4," right, dilshan's seen enough. he gets -999 short, he seemed to be waiting for it back in the recesses of the crease, and when it came he arched back and slammed it in front of square leg.",6
3953,8.04E+11,1.3," better shot from tharanga, opens the face and dabs a -999 to third man as it angles past him outside off",6
3954,8.04E+11,1.2," he's getting it to cut off the seam, this time cuts tharanga in half as it angles across him before jagging in off the track. tharanga has a lazy whip at it without moving the feet, and it misses the inside edge and the stumps.",6
3955,8.04E+11,1.1, back of a length and shaping into dilshan who is cramped as he tries to play the cut. he gets a -999 into the covers,6
3956,8.04E+11,44.6," attempted yorker, and smacked through long-on. shot",6
3957,8.04E+11,44.5," an ugly smear across the line from collingwood, not dissimilar to the shot that bowled him against india. but zaheer is a touch more rapid ...",6
3958,8.04E+11,44.4," zoinks, that was close. beaten first-up, outside off on the drive",6
3959,8.04E+11,44.3," stand and deliver! a flat-footed smack down the ground, but instead of a -999 over long-off, trott loses his off stump!",6
3960,8.04E+11,44.2," outside off, slightly short of a length so trott has to wait for it to arrive, and as a result his timing is off",6
3961,8.04E+11,44.1," a thumping pull, but straight to midwicket",6
3962,8.04E+11,37.6, touch shorter to trott and he has to stand tall to cut carefully -999 on the off side,9
3963,8.04E+11,37.5," after all that modern business, bell reaches for the textbook and drives beautifully down the ground",9
3964,8.04E+11,37.4," oh, if he failed bell would have been criticised. but he didn't. jumps outside off stump, gets down on -999 knee and dabs this just over short fine leg for -999",9
3965,8.04E+11,37.3," fuller and wider, invites a flash from trott that speeds -999 to deep point",9
3966,8.04E+11,37.2, bell uses the width on offer to dink a cut shot to third man. england really coasting at the moment,9
3967,8.04E+11,37.1," johnston as accurate as ever and trott as efficient as ever, opening the face to pinch a -999 to point",9
3968,8.04E+11,34.6," workmanlike over, full of singles and doubles, ends with bell chipping another -999 to the midwicket region",6
3969,8.04E+11,34.5, shorter ball that bell spoons wide of long-on to bring up his second successive half-century,6
3970,8.04E+11,34.4, trott skips down the -999 and fiddles into the leg side,6
3971,8.04E+11,34.3," driven to cover, no great intent",6
3972,8.04E+11,34.2," fuller ball, bell threads down the ground",6
3973,8.04E+11,34.1, trott glides a shortish ball backwards of point,6
3974,8.04E+11,33.6," straighter, a little too straight and trott fiddles around the corner",7
3975,8.04E+11,33.6," touch harsh this from the umpire. especially given the pitch is dreamy for batting. it was wide of off and trott missed a cut shot, only to be reprieved by the umpire",7
3976,8.04E+11,33.5," even fuller this time, straighter too, and meets a full and straight bat",7
3977,8.04E+11,33.4," better ball, hitting a length and bell is forced back to defend",7
3978,8.04E+11,33.3, touch short and bell wheels a pull shot. timing it very nicely to beat midwicket. rankin continues to leak runs this tournament,7
3979,8.04E+11,33.2," bell cascades down the track, more fidgety than menacing, only to defend",7
3980,8.04E+11,33.1," starts well, landing back of a length around off stump. bell on his toes to defend",7
3981,8.04E+11,29.6," on the pads, tucked square",11
3982,8.04E+11,29.5, nudged -999 to square leg,11
3983,8.04E+11,29.4," on the pads, turned down the leg-side",11
3984,8.04E+11,29.3," the sledgehammer breaks the ice! down the track, a beautifully timed lofted drive, over the ropes at long-off!",11
3985,8.04E+11,29.2, -999 men in the circle but trott finds the -999,11
3986,8.04E+11,29.1," a touch of room to work the gap, as dockrell drops an inch short and bell steps back and across for a flick to midwicket",11
3987,8.04E+11,27.6," a calm sweep to keep the strike, but another wonderfully cool over",3
3988,8.04E+11,27.5," teasing work, subtle variations on every delivery. five men up in the circle to keep the pressure on",3
3989,8.04E+11,27.4," back of a length, cut firmly to cover, but so little pace on the ball",3
3990,8.04E+11,27.3," solid block, bat and pad tight together on line of middle and leg",3
3991,8.04E+11,27.2," stays back in the crease this time, and nurdles into the legside",3
3992,8.04E+11,27.1," down the track, but dockrell's flight is too flighty. bell can't get to the pitch properly",3
3993,8.04E+11,21.6," quicker delivery, rising onto the toes to punch into the covers. good over",4
3994,8.04E+11,21.5," singles, singles everywhere. calm accumulation for now",4
3995,8.04E+11,21.4," firm drive, full face of the bat. another -999 to long-off",4
3996,8.04E+11,21.3, flicked off the toes -999 to midwicket,4
3997,8.04E+11,21.2," driven hard, back to the bowler, who fields well - low, in his followthrough",4
3998,8.04E+11,21.1," on the toes, a touch too full, flicked down to fine leg",4
3999,8.04E+11,14.6," damaging over that, despite ending with a dot",15
4000,8.04E+11,14.5," this time it's defended, mooney getting his length right",15
4001,8.04E+11,14.4," wow, pietersen gets all of this. gone a mile! just a touch too short, pietersen was lunging forward but rocked back and dismissed it from his sight, swatting high into the stands over midwicket",15
4002,8.04E+11,14.3," worked square of the -999, looks in fine order so far",15
4003,8.04E+11,14.2," too short from mooney, too wide too. the pitch is coming on nicely so that's asking for trouble. trott, with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of timing, cuts past a sprawling third man",15
4004,8.04E+11,14.1," nicely done, trott is actually a very efficient driver of the ball. gets some width, and the right length and neatly punches a drive to the point boundary",15
4005,8.04E+11,13.6," trott is -999 in classic trott fashion, getting deep into his crease and flicking a -999 to deep midwicket",3
4006,8.04E+11,13.5," hint of edge here as trott goes back to cut, runs harmlessly to short third man",3
4007,8.04E+11,13.4, very straight and a touch of flight from dockrell and careful defence from trott,3
4008,8.04E+11,13.3," dockrell strikes again! strauss -999 for 34 on his 34th birthday. dockrell maintained his line, strauss jumped outside off to try and manufacture a shovel to leg, in the end he couldn't catch up with the ball and it went straight into his stumps",3
4009,8.04E+11,13.2, pietersen gets himself off strike by dinking a -999,3
4010,8.04E+11,13.2, dockrell intent on preventing width but goes too far this time and spears down the leg side,3
4011,8.04E+11,13.1," that's the delivery that pietersen gets into trouble with against left-arm spinners. skidding on with the angle, he looked to give himself room expecting turn before hurrying a jab down when it didn't come",3
4012,8.04E+11,12.6," very similar delivery and this time strauss did try and work a -999 with a flick of the wrists, but too early on the ball and a leading edge causes a flutter of alarm",4
4013,8.04E+11,12.5," good delivery this, back of a length, tight on off stump. strauss would have to invent to find runs, he doesn't",4
4014,8.04E+11,12.4," strained appeal from the bowler, but he didn't get much company as this thuds off strauss's pads. it was heading down",4
4015,8.04E+11,12.3, very swift running earns a -999 to short third man despite a direct hit. pietersen dabbed and strauss called him through in a hurry,4
4016,8.04E+11,12.2, just the slightest bit of width and strauss dabs a delicate sing  to fine third man,4
4017,8.04E+11,12.1," starts down the leg side, and flicked -999 as a result with strauss scampering back for a second",4
4018,8.04E+11,8.6," a misjudgement from strauss, and that drops inches short of short midwicket. a late indecision - should he pull or shouldn't it - nearly costs the skipper!",10
4019,8.04E+11,8.5," tucked off the toes, a scamper to mid-on",10
4020,8.04E+11,8.4," floated up, a touch too full, and pietersen drills this on the up, through the gap, and -999 to the cover boundary",10
4021,8.04E+11,8.3," driven to mid-off, but too well timed and kp wisely opts against a red bull run",10
4022,8.04E+11,8.2," on the pads, worked -999 to square leg",10
4023,8.04E+11,8.1," that's a cute shot from strauss. the keeper was standing up, the slips were absent, so a delicate deflection races for -999 through third man",10
4024,8.04E+11,7.6," an imperceptible shuffle at the crease, but kp's extra room doesn't result in a booming drive through the covers. merely a nudge to point",4
4025,8.04E+11,7.5," shovelled into the leg side, another well-selected -999",4
4026,8.04E+11,7.4," on the pads, flicked but intercepted by short backward square. a let-off",4
4027,8.04E+11,7.3, patted back down the track. good length again,4
4028,8.04E+11,7.2," a push and go from strauss, mid-off was set back, and his instant call worked a treat",4
4029,8.04E+11,7.1, worked off the pads for a -999,4
4030,8.04E+11,3.6," angled into the pads, and nudged to midwicket",5
4031,8.04E+11,3.5," outside off, attempts the dab, but doesn't get enough on it",5
4032,8.04E+11,3.4," too much width, and the skipper has a thrash. no control on the shot, but none needed. he went hard, and third man couldn't cut that off",5
4033,8.04E+11,3.3," watchful work from strauss, treating each ball on its merits",5
4034,8.04E+11,3.2," tighter line, kp tries to work the -999 into the leg-side, but gets into a slight tangle. no great alarm",5
4035,8.04E+11,3.1," outside off, no stroke offered",5
4036,8.04E+11,0.6," that's a cracking shot, kp was walking across his stumps before the ball was released, and he used the natural angle to lever a ball from outside off through midwicket, all along the ground. classy",7
4037,8.04E+11,0.5," striding forward, but not quite there for the drive. rankin fields in his followthrough",7
4038,8.04E+11,0.4," slightly offline, and a firm clip is well gathered at fine leg to save the boundary",7
4039,8.04E+11,0.3," nice start from rankin, wide of the crease, hitting a good length and angling in at off stump. defended",7
4040,8.04E+11,0.2," full length, an open-faced drive, squeezes through point to get the innings up and running",7
4041,8.04E+11,0.1," good line and length, angling across the left-hander, ignored by strauss with a raise of the bat",7
4042,8.04E+11,38.6," driven down the ground. wow. this is incredible. england are like a cork bobbing on the ocean of the world cup, rising and falling to meet the quality of their opponents",4

4225,8.04E+11,43.6," cannot do much with this -999 around off, and pats it -999",6
4226,8.04E+11,43.5," lovely drive from utseys, he made a bit of room, jesse helped by bowling it wide outside off stump, and he opened the face of the blade to drive it past a diving extra cover, and wide of sweeper cover as well",6
4227,8.04E+11,43.4, hit -999 down to long on this time,6
4228,8.04E+11,43.3," looks to heave this -999 -999 in to oblivion, but the inside edge ensures it does not get farther than midwicket",6

4240,8.04E+11,37.3, down the track and drives down the ground to long on,2
4241,8.04E+11,37.2," lovely delivery, the -999 that goes straight on, he was pushing inside the line expecting some turn, there was none, brendon collects",2

4258,8.04E+11,8.3," and again, not getting a good enough stride across, and not staying put on leg stump either. this -999 carries nicely from back of a length, past his waft and into the keeper's gloves",1
4259,8.04E+11,8.2, ervine is not very sure of his off stump yet. mills again hits that seam and gets it to move -999 from the batsman who plods half forward and prods half certainly,1

4263,8.04E+11,6.4," brendan may be in trouble now. lbw appeal turned down, and refered. landed on off stump, short of a length and then came in off the seam, brendan was guilty of looking to play around the pads, and he missed. hits in line, but replays say it was barely clipping the top of middle and leg. that is going to save him. umpire erasmus sticks to his original verdict.",4
4264,8.04E+11,6.3," whoa, nathan, leave the beamers for when you are bowling! taibu puches to mid off with pristine timing and makes his ground. nathan mccullium throws it straight at his head, taibu ducks and it then hits the stumps at the striker's end.",4
4265,8.04E+11,6.2," lovely stuff from mills. he's been getting them to curve -999 for the most part, but this time he nips -999 back in off the seam. taibu realised very late that it was coming in, and had to cover the gap between bat and pad in a hurry. the ball snuck through, but missed the stumps.",4

4277,8.04E+11,25.2," whoa, brendon skips -999 of the crease and gets a short of length ball angling into the body. he whips it with furious timing, and nearly holes -999 to the man at deep backward square leg.",9

4284,8.04E+11,20.1," now that dilshan has taken the copyright for the scoop shot, brendon seems to want to make the reverse sweep all his own. plays it as well as anyone else in the world. this -999 is tossed up around leg stump, he reverses the grip, twists the wrists and goes with the spin through third man",10
4285,8.04E+11,9.6," flighted on off stump, guptill opens the face and steers it square.",1
4286,8.04E+11,9.5," flat and straight on leg stump, defended solidly down the track",1

4304,8.04E+11,0.5, another edge but this brings a huge roar. siddique's slash flies over the slips and races to the third-man boundary. that was short of a length and wide outside off again,4
4305,8.04E+11,0.4, defended on the front foot on the off side,4
4306,8.04E+11,0.3," a hush falls over the shere bangla as tamim departs for a duck. the ball was fuller and wider outside off stump and tamim, who let the previous -999 go, chased this. he went really hard at the ball, aiming to lash it through cover, but ended up nicking it to second slip, where sammy caught it. and look at those celebrations ... massive -999",4
4307,8.04E+11,0.2, and this ball dies as tamim shoulders arms once again and bounces just in front of the wicketkeeper. thomas and the slips come up a step or -999.,4

4335,8.04E+11,6.5, goes in search of the yorker but sprays it down the leg side,7
4336,8.04E+11,6.4," what a take! tharanga cannot believe it, it was that short and wide delivery that he likes to take toll of, but it bounced a shade too much for his comfort, tand he cut it in the air past point, or thought he had, but steve smith there pulled off a stunner, timing his leap at full stretch to perfection, taking it -999 handed, he juggled with it somewhat before taking it cleanly in the end, that ball was really traveling like a bullet, if not a 'tracer' bullet",7
4337,8.04E+11,6.3," short -999 on leg stump, he goes outside the line and tries to turn it past a very short short fine leg, but he puts in the dive to stop a certain boundary",7

4342,8.04E+11,1.4," tait has won this short but searing battle, dilshan was on the crease, maybe expecting a bouncer, it was that bait again, moving -999 from a length outside off, dilshan threw everything at it, and the edge flew at a comfortable height to white at second slip, tait is pumped up, really is",5

4360,8.04E+11,39.5," this is lovely stuff from yuvraj, and another nifty bit of keeping from dhoni. flighted onto middle and leg, it lands and breaks -999 sharply as cusack plays a lazy wafty flick without getting to the pitch. dhoni collects and whips the bails off as cusack drags his toes -999, but he seems to have brought them back in, just in time.",7
4361,8.04E+11,39.4," mooney gets -999 on the pads, and clips down to square leg for a -999",7
4362,8.04E+11,39.3," aha, this -999 stops and breaks -999 from cusack who is a little early into the punch down the ground, and yuvraj might have thought he had a chance as he dived to his left. too far from him though.",7

5042,8.04E+11,44.6," drifts down the leg side, misses everything so a bonus ball for england",11
5043,8.04E+11,44.5, another goes in the powerplay...bopara's struggle is over as he backs -999 and slaps it straight to cover. he couldn't play the finishing role today,11
5044,8.04E+11,44.4, lofted straight down the ground and swann is quickly back to the non-striker's end,11
5045,8.04E+11,44.3," finally manages to get -999 through the covers, did well to connect well enough as it didn't bounce much but it was very short and gave bopara plenty of time",11

5047,8.04E+11,44.1, backs -999 to leg and yet again finds the fielder on the edge of the cover ring,11
5048,8.04E+11,32.6, very tight line cramps morgan for room and it can only be patted back to the bowler,2
5049,8.04E+11,32.5," good yorker here, shafiul bustling in as usual but finding a good line this time",2
5050,8.04E+11,32.4," big wind up from morgan, looked like he wanted to flip into the leg side, but the line was too close to off and he had to defend",2

5052,8.04E+11,32.2, trott times a fuller ball very firmly down the ground to mid-off,2
5053,8.04E+11,32.1, bit of grunt from shafiul as he delivers and it slides off the face down to third man,2

5064,8.04E+11,28.2, worked -999 from middle stump along the ground through midwicket,7
5065,8.04E+11,28.1, that very familiar shot from trott as he whips it through square leg off the back foot and some good running makes it -999,7
5066,8.04E+11,27.6, pushed into the covers,7
5067,8.04E+11,27.5," uses his feet and is taken on the pad, half an appeal but it's outside leg stump and the result is a couple of leg byes to fine leg",7
5068,8.04E+11,27.4, defended into the off side,7
5069,8.04E+11,27.3," ooh, well bowled, he cuts morgan in half with -999 that nips back off the seam to the left hander",7

5071,8.04E+11,27.1," great timing...a touch short from rubel and it's just a flick off his hip from trott, bisected fine leg and deep square at pace. trott's first boundary",7
5072,8.04E+11,26.6," clever from trott as he brings -999 the reverse sweep and gets it fine of short third man, but not quite enough pace to reach the rope",5
5073,8.04E+11,26.5, turned -999 to midwicket and it goes too quickly to allow a -999,5
5074,8.04E+11,26.4, pushed into the covers,5

5077,8.04E+11,26.1," touch short, allows trott to stay on the back foot to whip it -999 through midwicket...brings up england's 100, but it's been hard work",5
5078,8.04E+11,25.6," ooh, offered some width but he slashes and misses - undone by a lack of bounce",5
5079,8.04E+11,25.5," tight on middle, nothing for morgan to work with and he defends to cover",5

5085,8.04E+11,22.6, cut -999 to the deep cover sweeper,7
5086,8.04E+11,22.5, more excellent footwork from morgan as he skips down the pitch outside off then chips expertly over midwicket with sweet enough timing to beat long on,7

5088,8.04E+11,22.3, whipped off the back foot -999 to deep midwicket,7
5089,8.04E+11,22.2," tossed up from round the -999, pushed into the covers for a tight -999 as trott has to get a wriggle on",7

5096,8.04E+11,18.1," excellent work from morgan, skips down and drives firmly. only a diving stop at mid-on saved a boundary",4

5098,8.04E+11,17.5, perfectly straight bat meets an equally straight ball,1

5102,8.04E+11,17.1, hint of leading edge here back to the bowler,1
5103,8.04E+11,15.6, careful defence from trott,2
5104,8.04E+11,15.5," that'll do nicely for bell, down the -999 again and this time eases down to long-off",2
5105,8.04E+11,15.4, width on offer here but bell is struggling and can't time his drive. the crowd are sensing the pressure building,2
5106,8.04E+11,15.3, this time bell inside edges towards midwicket,2
5107,8.04E+11,15.2, bell skips down the -999 and has to scoot back almost as quick as his drive finds the bowler,2
5108,8.04E+11,15.1," razzak strays wide for once, and trott leaps at the opportunity to cut a -999 -999",2

5116,8.04E+11,7.1," -999, gone! what a bizzare dismissal, prior has had a brain fade. it drifted down the leg side, prior missed it and drags his back foot. rahim takes off the bails and prior is just safe, but then he stays -999 of his crease and rahim shows brilliant awareness to pull the stump -999 of the ground to complete the stumping a second time. brainless from prior, superb from rahim",3
5117,8.04E+11,6.6," ah, that's a shame, hint of width which allows strauss to cut again and this time it flies finer through third man",4
5118,8.04E+11,6.5, rocks back to make room to cut but point pulls off a good diving save...that's what bangladesh need,4
5119,8.04E+11,6.4," on middle and off, strauss defends to the leg side...showing naeem some early respect",4
5120,8.04E+11,6.3," wide outside off, left alone",4
5121,8.04E+11,6.2," round the -999, floated up and strauss defends",4
5122,8.04E+11,6.1," driven off the back to cover, very slow off the surface",4
5123,8.04E+11,4.6," edged! strauss loses control as he drives but no second slip in place, although it may have been wide of him, and it beats third man to cross the rope",12
5124,8.04E+11,4.5," pushed towards leg stump, trying to compensate, and it's worked down to long leg",12
5125,8.04E+11,4.4," that's a lovely shot, a long half volley which prior leans into and drives it perfectly through the covers...that's how he plays in test cricket",12

5127,8.04E+11,4.2, back of a length on off stump and prior defends back to the bowler,12
5128,8.04E+11,4.1, short on leg stump and it's tucked neatly -999 to deep square,12
5129,8.04E+11,2.6," full on middle and off, pushed to mid-on...a decent finish to the cover",6
5130,8.04E+11,2.5, full on off stump and pushed firmly towards the bowler...playing with the full face is key for prior,6
5131,8.04E+11,2.4," tighter to off stump, prior onto the front foot and pushed down to mid-on",6
5132,8.04E+11,2.3, hint of width and it's met with a flowing square drive which races between point and cover...that will make prior feel better,6
5133,8.04E+11,2.2," full outside off, drives and gets a thickish -999 edge down to third man",6
5134,8.04E+11,2.1, leans forward and opens the face to guide the ball through backward point...looks for -999 but third man is round quickly,6
5135,8.04E+11,32.6, full outside off and it's sweetly driven -999 to deep cover,2
5136,8.04E+11,32.5," big appeal for lbw and strauss calls for  review. there are -999 noises, but no bat. looks to be heading down the leg side and indeed it is so rahim survives",2
5137,8.04E+11,32.4, tight on the stumps and rahim can only defend,2
5138,8.04E+11,32.3, worked off middle to midwicket,2

5141,8.04E+11,29.6, shoved down the leg side a touch and it runs off the pads towards fine leg,10
5142,8.04E+11,29.6, blimey! not sure what happened here but bopara ended up landing this near his toe and it it looped up gently and wide outside off stump. horrid,10
5143,8.04E+11,29.5," lovely shot, floaty half-volley but imrul leant into it and creamed a drive through cover to bring up his 1000th odi run",10
5144,8.04E+11,29.4, shakib manages to squeeze a cut shot -999 to cover,10
5145,8.04E+11,29.3," wow, very delicate from imrul, opening the face at the last moment to steer down to third man",10
5146,8.04E+11,29.2," another false shot, inside edge this time squirts down to fine leg",10
5147,8.04E+11,29.1," play and miss outside off, this really did keep low. shakib swung well over the ball",10
5148,8.04E+11,27.6, shakib wanted a -999 here that didn't exist as he prodded this to midwicket. another wicketless over ticks by and bangladesh are edging closer. certain favourites from here but england games don't end easily,4
5149,8.04E+11,27.5, won't swing from that length. banged in too short and speared down the leg side. imrul worked it with the angle for a -999 towards fine leg,4
5150,8.04E+11,27.4, flash a miss again outside off! just a hint of reverse as well bending it past the edge,4
5151,8.04E+11,27.3, fifty for imrul and an absolutely crucial -999. gets there by steering this -999 to third man for a couple,4
5152,8.04E+11,27.2, flash and a miss outside off stump! not a great delivery but it scurried under the edge,4
5153,8.04E+11,27.1," that's certainly not it, long-hop sat up but shakib's pull shot went straight to fine leg",4
5154,8.04E+11,26.6, quiet and tidy over ticks by but england need a moment of inspiration to lift themselves here. -999 -999 and pressure will suddenly switch but for now bangladesh are coasting,4
5155,8.04E+11,26.5," diving stop, flinging himself to his left at cover keeps this to -999. but singles are all bangladesh need here",4
5156,8.04E+11,26.4," touch too short and too wide as well, cut fine and it scoots, all along the damp outfield, towards the third man rope. england are looking very glum at the moment",4
5157,8.04E+11,26.3," good work from collingwood, pinning imrul to the crease",4
5158,8.04E+11,26.2, prodded to cover again,4
5159,8.04E+11,26.1, collingwood flights this cutter a touch and is driven to cover,4
5160,8.04E+11,24.6," excellent batting, that's all they need to do. careful drive threaded through the infield towards deep point, smart running earns -999",3
5161,8.04E+11,24.5," good bowling here, full and straight. driven back to him",3
5162,8.04E+11,24.4, spin and bounce for collingwood! imrul prodded suspiciously at it,3
5163,8.04E+11,24.3, pushed to point as collingwood tosses this up again,3
5164,8.04E+11,24.2, this time shakib straightens his drive to milk a -999 down to long-off,3
5165,8.04E+11,24.1, collingwood tosses this up a touch and is driven to cover,3
5166,8.04E+11,17.6," full outside off, driven in the air but it goes wide of backward point down to third man",4
5167,8.04E+11,17.5, well bowled! a cracking yorker which zeros in on kayes' feet but somehow misses the stumps,4
5168,8.04E+11,17.4, uses the angle created from round the -999 to work it through midwicket,4
5169,8.04E+11,17.3," ooh, was that half a chance? indeed it was. punched back by shakib but shahzad couldn't get his right hand down in his follow through",4
5170,8.04E+11,17.2," angled into the pads, kayes doesn't connect as it bobbles into the leg side",4
5171,8.04E+11,17.1," round the -999, full on off stump and driven down to mid-off",4
5172,8.04E+11,10.6," compensates by going full outside off, it's well driven but short cover makes a sharp save",7
5173,8.04E+11,10.5, leg stump again and neatly flicked -999 by kayes...shahzad slides round on his knees to cut off the boundary,7
5174,8.04E+11,10.4," wrong line, on leg stump like so much of england's bowling and worked -999 to deep square",7
5175,8.04E+11,10.3," goes full at the stumps, met with a full face and driven back down the pitch",7
5176,8.04E+11,10.2, short ball and siddique goes for the pull but doesn't make contact,7
5177,8.04E+11,10.1, no slip and that edge has gone straight where -999 would have been stood as siddique aimed to play through third man,7
5178,8.04E+11,7.6," so after a poor first ball swann finishes well but he's not at all happy with the conditions. can't grip the ball, he tells the umpire",4
5179,8.04E+11,7.5," best ball of the innings here, dragging imrul forward in defence",4
5180,8.04E+11,7.4, touch fuller and pushed back to the bowler,4
5181,8.04E+11,7.3, zooter/slider/ball that doesn't spin. imrul leaves alone,4
5182,8.04E+11,7.2," better ball this time, flatter and around middle stump. imrul works to fine leg",4
5183,8.04E+11,7.1," slippery ball or what -999 don't now but this was really floated up, long half-volley outside off stump and imrul clattered it wide of cover to bring up the 50-stand. that didn't take long!",4
5184,8.04E+11,1.6," beaten! much better delivery here, lands just outside off and zips -999 past a groping outside edge",7
5185,8.04E+11,1.5," not the right place to bowl really, on the pads and tamim can help himself to a -999",7
5186,8.04E+11,1.4," imrul apes tamim, though without the same panache and works a -999 towards square leg",7
5187,8.04E+11,1.3," flick of the wrists earns tamim -999, would have been -999 but for an excellent full-length slide along the square-leg boundary from morgan. it was full around middle and off and tamim just whipped his wrists through the delivery",7
5188,8.04E+11,1.2, this is close enough for tamim and he flicks with the around-the--999 angle through the leg side for a couple,7
5189,8.04E+11,1.1," starts tidily enough, searching for swing at a full length outside off stump",7
5190,8.04E+11,43.6," bizarre batting, virat pushes the ball gently back to peterson, a easy caught and bowled. south africa are right back in this. peterson flings the ball in celebration and they are pumped.",3
5191,8.04E+11,43.5, it looked like virat got an edge as he tried to force it off the back foot but van wyk failed to hold on,3
5192,8.04E+11,43.4," short ball on leg stump, pulled towards deep square leg",3
5193,8.04E+11,43.3, a perfect forward defence towards the bowler,3

5196,8.04E+11,38.6," the slower bouncer and tendulkar tries to slash it, or something, and misses. steyn thinks he's nicked it and the keeper appeals very late. they aren't asking for a review though",5
5197,8.04E+11,38.5, gambhir backs -999 to make room and biffs the ball towards mid-off ... steyn's bowled an excellent over so far,5
5198,8.04E+11,38.4," the slower ball and it keeps a touch low, tendulkar pushes the ball towards square leg and sets off, there's a fumble from the fielder",5
5199,8.04E+11,38.3, chipped down to third man for a -999,5
5200,8.04E+11,38.2, gambhir plays the ball to midwicket and sets off for a risky -999. he would have been -999 if the ball had hit direct at the bowler's end. they try an overthrow and this time tendulkar would have been -999 had there been a direct hit at the bowler's end,5
5201,8.04E+11,38.1, short of a length and gambhir backs -999 to make room and slaps the ball towards mid-on. it falls short of the fielder,5

5205,8.04E+11,37.3, length ball outside off stump and tendulkar dismisses it. dismisses it with a powerful slap of his bat off the front foot. he connected that at chest height,10
5206,8.04E+11,37.2," tight line and length from morkel on middle, played towards midwicket",10
5207,8.04E+11,37.1," tendulkar charges and mis-times the ball in the air through midwicket, it's in the air but just wide of the fielder",10

5209,8.04E+11,33.5," short ball and tendulkar pulls, the crowd screams in unison as they think it's a -999. it isn't.",10
5210,8.04E+11,33.4, played on the leg side for a -999,10
5211,8.04E+11,33.3," duminy strays down leg side and gambhir plays a fine paddle, du plessis chases after it and dives head first to try and save the boundary. he doesn't and then crashes into the thick advertisement hoardings. the electronic ones. careful man!",10
5212,8.04E+11,33.2," gambhir charges and lofts the ball over extra cover, splitting the gap between deep cover and long off",10

5216,8.04E+11,23.4," gambhir comes down the track, he's not quite to the pitch but tries to drive -999 on the leg side. the ball bounces short of that man at the close straight midwicket/mid-on",4

5899,8.04E+11,15.3," strays onto the pads this time, haddin nudges a -999 backward of square",5
5900,8.04E+11,15.2," turning -999 from middle and off, steered carefully into the covers off the back foot",5
5901,8.04E+11,15.1," rao keeps it on the pads all the time, watto works it off the back foot to square leg for -999",5
5902,8.04E+11,7.6," if he did not edge that, haddin might have escaped again. inducker from back of a length, cramps him into another hoicked pull across the line. umpire saheba turns down the appeal, baidwan wants a review. bagai thinks long and hard, and chooses not to refer it. the ball came in and thudded into the pads in front of middle and off. middle and leg were being hit and replays confirm that did not get an inside edge. canada should have reviewed it!",5
5903,8.04E+11,7.5, back of a length on off stump and punched confidently into the covers,5
5904,8.04E+11,7.4," fuller length to haddin who plays an iffy, all-over-the-shop kind of stroke down the ground without moving the feet. he makes almost no contact",5
5905,8.04E+11,7.3," short of a length again on middle stump, worked around the pads to the leg side",5
5906,8.04E+11,7.2," sublime timing from watson, just plonks the front foot across and flows through the line. he probably was early on the shot, but he middled it really well. what looked like a check drive ended as a lofted boundary to long on",5
5907,8.04E+11,7.1, short of a length and angling into watson who defends to the leg side from the crease,5
5908,8.04E+11,42.6, roach slips this past the inside edge and it thuds off the pads,3
5909,8.04E+11,42.5," excellent delivery this time. on off stump and offering to slide in, solid defence",3
5910,8.04E+11,42.4, oh bresnan missed -999 there. thigh-high full toss but he could only pat it to midwicket,3
5911,8.04E+11,42.3," back of a length and wright aimed a leg-side swish, too quick on him so couldn't time it",3
5912,8.04E+11,42.2, full and crashed to mid-off,3
5913,8.04E+11,42.2," oops, shoved down the leg side and but for an excellent take on the half-volley from thomas could have been five",3
5914,8.04E+11,42.1," banged in short and it flies over wright, who ducked more -999 of courtesy than necessity",3
5915,8.04E+11,33.6, worked into the leg side,3
5916,8.04E+11,33.5, plenty of turn outside off as tredwell shoulders arms,3

5920,8.04E+11,33.1, full and driven down to long off,3
5921,8.04E+11,7.6," another short -999, russell needs to find a way to calm into this contest, strauss powers another pull shot but the sweeper tides up on the leg-side boundary",7
5922,8.04E+11,7.5," no no, short is not the place for strauss. he gets all of this pull shot and it speeds to the fine leg rope",7
5923,8.04E+11,7.4," my my, russell is not impressed and bangs in a sharp bouncer that has strauss ducking in a hurry. follows the delivery with a stare",7
5924,8.04E+11,7.3," yup, strauss definitely wants a bit of this. dancing down the -999 again to try and thwack this through the off side. doesn't time it remotely",7
5925,8.04E+11,7.2," short again and strauss wants a tilt at russell -999 reckon, wheeling a pull shot to deep midwicket",7
5926,8.04E+11,7.1," ooh nervous start from the bowler, touch short and some width too but strauss can't time his cut shot",7
5927,8.04E+11,6.6," after all that heaving strauss is back to compact mode, flicking  an off-stump delivery wide of midwicket",6
5928,8.04E+11,6.5," heave and miss outside off! strauss leant back and aimed something expansive, but only at thin air",6
5929,8.04E+11,6.4, again roach ventures near the pads but strauss picks -999 midwicket,6
5930,8.04E+11,6.3," very nicely done here from the england captain. couple of steps down the track and, as miller would tell you, strauss is violent off his pad, flicking to the midwicket boundary",6
5931,8.04E+11,6.2," on the pads to strauss, which miller reckons is a no-go area, but strauss picks -999 square leg",6
5932,8.04E+11,6.1, back of length but the line is just leg-sided enough for prior to nurdle a -999 to fine leg,6
5933,8.04E+11,34.6, sarwan wanted a -999 here as he clipped to midwicket. russell just slipped so it prevented a -999,4
5934,8.04E+11,34.5, very calm and careful block to cover and russell has a -999 in a hurry,4
5935,8.04E+11,34.4," good cricket from sarwan, blocking to long-on. that brings russell on strike. gets a word of advice from sarwan",4
5936,8.04E+11,34.3," short enough for sarwan to land a cut shot, chopping down to deep point to steal a couple. he's played so well today",4
5937,8.04E+11,34.2," touch of spin here from outside off, nothing to trouble sarwan though",4
5938,8.04E+11,34.1, won't find -999 yet because sarwan is solid and quiet in defence,4
5939,8.04E+11,33.6," russell expansive again but didn't get all of this, aimed to try and smash it over midwicket but the lack of timing sent it -999-bounce to the fielder on the boundary. russell looks in mighty fine order, could be a matchwinner unless england strike soon. time for swann surely?",6
5940,8.04E+11,33.5," ooh, almost more damage for tremlett as russell swatted a short ball powerfully towards the midwicket rope",6
5941,8.04E+11,33.4, another good delivery heading for off stump is steered to point. russell is through for the -999 in a flash,6
5942,8.04E+11,33.3, fuller this time and driven back towards tremlett. who fields before crumpling over for no good reason,6
5943,8.04E+11,33.2, won't be any swing from there. but at least for tremlett it's not a boundary. short and rising to sarwan who defends easily,6
5944,8.04E+11,33.1," good start here, finds a fullish length and it just nips -999 a touch. tremlett appealed but it was actually edged onto pad",6

5955,8.04E+11,21.2," tight stuff, on middle and off, not much bounce and pollard is almost caught on the back foot",0
5956,8.04E+11,21.1," well bowled, hint of movement which squares up pollard and finds a leading edge into the covers",0
5957,8.04E+11,16.6," good ball to end the over, forcing quiet defence outside off. reckon with these -999 right handers in that might be tredwell's spell",4
5958,8.04E+11,16.5," short again, sat up asking for trouble, sammy banged it hard but to deep cover",4
5959,8.04E+11,16.4," little bit too short and wide, allows thomas to punch a drive through cover",4
5960,8.04E+11,16.4, the spin here takes it down the leg side for a wide,4
5961,8.04E+11,16.3," big turn here, touch of bounce too and thomas taps it to midwicket",4
5962,8.04E+11,16.2, this would have been a wide if sammy didn't help it to fine leg,4

5971,8.04E+11,6.5," gone! has tredwell done it? gayle given lbw but he's reviewed it. no bat, this looks good. and the decision stays. massive breakthrough for england. gayle played forward and was struck below the knee roll. replays said it was clipping the top of the stumps",5
5972,8.04E+11,6.4," now he brings -999 a slog sweep, picks it up from off stump and sends it whistle flat over midwicket",5

6071,8.04E+11,42.6," he's been fortunate and continues to be, short and buurman charges down the track to slash that over point, flies off the outside edge to the third-man boundary, mooney's unlucky, maybe he'll bloig about it for us some day",10
6072,8.04E+11,42.5," shortish, coming back in, tries to open the face there but is beaten",10
6073,8.04E+11,42.4, short on the off and he backs -999 of that -999,10
6074,8.04E+11,42.3," lands safely, short of a good length and he goes for a mighty pull, it ends up being a miscue, lands wide of kevin o'brien running to his left at deep square leg, covered good ground but not quickly enough, he's not the quickest runner -999 there",10
6075,8.04E+11,42.2," edged and -999, streaky, short of a good length, pushes at it off the back foot with a slightly open face, there's no slip and it flies off the edge to the third-man boundary",10
6076,8.04E+11,42.1," comes down the track and has a wild swing, short of a good length but he failed to connect, looked unlikely to connect, was more -999 of desperation than anything",10
6077,8.04E+11,34.6," sweeting timing by ten doeschate, came off the meat, was pitched full outside off, he stretches forward and just caresses it through extra cover, andrew white slides to his and hauls it back in with his legs, good stop in the end",5
6078,8.04E+11,34.5," on middle and leg, struck on the thighs as he tries to work it -999, lobs up in the direction of square leg, picks a -999",5
6079,8.04E+11,34.4," and again, borren is tempted to poke at it, in the channel outside off, beaten once more",5
6080,8.04E+11,34.3," short of a good length outside off, fishes for it, getting some good bounce is johnston, beats the outside edge as he chases it",5
6081,8.04E+11,34.2," meaty delivery on middle and leg, clipped off the pads towards deep square leg for a -999",5
6082,8.04E+11,34.1," you know it's a new -999 if it moves that way, lovely deviation off the pitch -999 from the batsman, he leaves it alone",5
6083,8.04E+11,31.6," pitched up on middle, he senses a chance, midwicket is up and he struck it hard and over that fielder to beat wide long-on to the ropes",8
6084,8.04E+11,31.5, comes down the track and drives it to long-on,8
6085,8.04E+11,31.4, gets forward and dabs it into the leg side,8
6086,8.04E+11,31.3," drilled wide of long-off, was a full toss and he creamed it but there was  fielder in the deep, just the -999",8
6087,8.04E+11,29.6, struck hard towards cover but fails to beat the in-field,5
6088,8.04E+11,29.5," dropped in front of square l,eg",5
6089,8.04E+11,29.4, worked -999 in the direction of square leg,5
6090,8.04E+11,29.3, crunched down towards long-off,5
6091,8.04E+11,29.2, turned -999 towards square leg,5
6092,8.04E+11,29.1, tapped towards point for a -999,5
6093,8.04E+11,13.6," again he gives the bowler the charge, but dockrell spots him coming and drags the length down ... barrsi doesn't get to the pitch but lays bat on ball to pick up -999 to cover",5
6094,8.04E+11,13.5," tossed up again, defence this time",5
6095,8.04E+11,13.4, up and over mid-off! he was always going to have a go with the field up. strong shot,5
6096,8.04E+11,13.3," almost! flighted up bravely by dockrell, the ball drifted in through the air and took a thick inside edge into the pad ... hands on head for the bowler",5
6097,8.04E+11,13.2," driven hard to mid-on, barresi's looking to be positive",5
6098,8.04E+11,13.1," good start, full and straight and defended",5
6099,8.04E+11,5.6," aggressive batting! ten doeschate walks across to off and tries to muscle a length delivery through the leg side ... not much timing in the shot, however, so just the -999",9
6100,8.04E+11,5.5," too full, ten doeschate steps forward and drives hard into the ground, the ball bounces up and over a diving cover fielder",9
6101,8.04E+11,5.4," again ten doeschate walks across to off, trying to upset the bowler's line, but johnston follows him and the shot is stopped at cover point",9
6102,8.04E+11,5.3," johnston re-adjusts his line, ten doeschate taps down to gully",9
6103,8.04E+11,5.2," lifted to wide midwicket! johnston aimed at middle and off and ten doeschate walked across his stumps, getting inside the line and flicking with plenty of bottom hand to find the boundary",9
6104,8.04E+11,5.1," johnston continues to send them down on off, ten doeschate patiently leaves alone",9
6105,8.04E+11,4.6," cracked very hard down the ground this time, the ball being much fuller, but rankin sticks his right boot -999 to stop the shot",6
6106,8.04E+11,4.5," same shot, forcing off the back foot, but this time he take the bounce into account, deliberately lifting the ball over gully and beating third man too",6
6107,8.04E+11,4.4," beaten outside off, it was the extra bounce that did it",6
6108,8.04E+11,4.3," short and rising, not the bouncer but up into the armpit and pulled down to fine leg",6
6109,8.04E+11,4.2," full on off stump, kervezee taps just to the left of mid-off and finds enough of the gap for them to sneak a -999 as the fielder runs round",6
6110,8.04E+11,4.1," bouncer! there's plenty of life in the -999, and this -999 bursts over the batsman's head ... actually probably bounced a bit too much, he was easily under it",6
6111,8.04E+11,44.6," blocked off the front foot, absolute coolness from niall, ireland need nothing else right now",10
6112,8.04E+11,44.5," squeezes this -999 wide of third man, another couple",10
6113,8.04E+11,44.4," but it is his brother on strike, keeps a cool head, lofts a fuller -999 over extra cover, sweeper cover manages to get there, does he touch the ropes, does he not?",10
6114,8.04E+11,44.3," buurman holds on, stutters but holds on, went for the big pull, it hurried on to him, went steepling in to the kolkata evening, when it came down buurman was there, fell down but took it cleanly, it's that man tendo who creates a crack of an opening, can netherlands barge in?",10
6115,8.04E+11,44.2," couple more, slapped -999 wide of sweeper cover",10
6116,8.04E+11,44.1," got to feel for netherlands, nothing has gone their way, he throws the bat at a full -999 outside off, and buurman cannot get to the outside edge as the ball flies past him",10
6117,8.04E+11,38.6," played -999 to midwicket for a -999 maiden, lovely stuff, netherlands are hanging on by the tips of their fingers",0
6118,8.04E+11,38.5," and midwicket dives to his left to save what looked like a certain run, the crowd love it, this is a tight over",0
6119,8.04E+11,38.4," turned in to the leg side, still not -999",0
6120,8.04E+11,38.3," already he charges down the track for the big on, squeezes it -999 to the bowler",0
6121,8.04E+11,38.2, carefully patted -999 with the turn to midwicket,0
6122,8.04E+11,38.1," cooper gets another -999, joyce is walking, again that cut to a wide delivery, this -999 didn't bounce as much as the -999 that got porterfield, but he had to reach -999 for the shot, and got the edge through to the keeper, neat take, cooper cannot stop smiling",0
6123,8.04E+11,30.6," finally he gets the -999, down the ground to long on",1
6124,8.04E+11,30.5," he is getting impatient, skips down the track, and belts the drive, but cannot get it past mid off",1
6125,8.04E+11,30.4," dug -999 down the track, still no -999",1
6126,8.04E+11,30.3," tries to break free with a forceful drive, but netherlands have found new energy, extra cover dives to keep the strangle on",1
6127,8.04E+11,30.2," tossed up very full, he pats it down the track",1
6128,8.04E+11,30.1, turned off the pads straight to midwicket,1
6129,8.04E+11,28.6," this time he will get runs, stretches forward and goes wide of sweeper cover",4
6130,8.04E+11,28.5," guides another -999 wide of backward point, cannot get the -999",4
6131,8.04E+11,28.4, defended off the front foot to the bowler,4
6132,8.04E+11,28.3," runs this -999 with the turn wide of backward point, the non-striker isn't interested",4
6133,8.04E+11,28.2," flighted very full, driven with the turn to sweeper cover again",4
6134,8.04E+11,28.1, carves this -999 -999 off the back foot and wide of sweeper cover,4
6135,8.04E+11,25.6," waits in the crease to a tossed up ball, and punches it to sweeper cover in the end",6
6136,8.04E+11,25.5, worked backward of square leg this time,6
6137,8.04E+11,25.4," tossed up generously high in the air, lovely revs on the ball, dips on the batsman who drives it down the ground",6
6138,8.04E+11,25.3," drags it short even as he charges down the pitch, and gets it down to long on with the momentum",6
6139,8.04E+11,25.2," fired in on middle stump, defended off the front foot",6
6140,8.04E+11,25.1, hits this turning short delivery to long on off the back foot,6
6141,8.04E+11,20.6," skips down the track and  looks to have a huge swing over midwicket, but misses completely and takes it on the pads",8
6142,8.04E+11,20.5," another dropped chance, a tough -999 this time, netherlands just cannot hold on, it was smashed over tendo, he got both hands to it, but it few right through",8
6143,8.04E+11,20.4," ver low full toss, he adjusts, and pats it -999 on the leg side",8
6144,8.04E+11,20.3," driven stylishly off the front foot, but right to the bowler",8
6145,8.04E+11,20.2," porterfield has taken over from stirling, has he, stays in the crease to a short delivery and flat bats it high over mid on, some bounces, and in to the boundary",8
6146,8.04E+11,20.1," goes for the big swing over midwicket, misses but still picks up the -999",8
6147,8.04E+11,15.6," yet another -999, netherlands cannot plug the gaps at the moment, there are millions of them all around, he shuffles across outside off and works it through square leg",9
6148,8.04E+11,15.5, brings up the 100 with another comfortable run to long on,9
6149,8.04E+11,15.4," low full toss, initially surprised but recovers to hit it to long on",9
6150,8.04E+11,15.3, he skips down very gracefully and eases it -999 to long on,9
6151,8.04E+11,15.2," goes for the slog now, and gets it down to deep midwicket,",9
6152,8.04E+11,15.1," can be risky but looks good when it comes off, he gets front leg way outside off stump, and sweeps a full delivery on the stumps to the deep square leg boundary",9
6153,8.04E+11,12.6," can't get the high full toss -999, pats it -999 to extra cover",0
6154,8.04E+11,12.5," looks to force a fuller delivery through midwicket, gets too close to the ball, and hits it to mid on",0
6155,8.04E+11,12.4," 123.-999 kph goes for the yorker, he digs it -999 towards extra cover",0
6156,8.04E+11,12.3," slapped -999 to covers, still cannot beat the packed off side in field",0
6157,8.04E+11,12.2," cracks a confident drive this time, but it goes right to mid off",0
6158,8.04E+11,12.1," looks to pull -999 angled across him that is not that short, off the bottom edge fine on the off side",0
6159,8.04E+11,43.6," slower from afridi, smith guides to short third man",4
6160,8.04E+11,43.5, smith ambles up the -999 and aims a whip to leg. defeated by a touch of spin,4
6161,8.04E+11,43.4, dragged down a touch short and cut firmly -999 to deep point,4
6162,8.04E+11,43.3," carefully worked -999, much quicker delivery",4
6163,8.04E+11,43.2, this is held back a touch and pushed into space,4
6164,8.04E+11,43.1, afridi brings himself back into the attack  and almost squeezes through the defence but it bobbles off an edge,4
6165,8.04E+11,34.6, an eventful introduction from the evergreen razzaq. how long has he been around now?,2
6166,8.04E+11,34.5," a hard-handed poke outside off, the slip was there but he couldn't get close, though third man tidies up",2
6167,8.04E+11,34.4," that was coming all the way through that over. clarke didn't look happy at razzaq's box of tricks, and an attempted pull somehow wriggles through the stroke to dislodge the off bail",2
6168,8.04E+11,34.3," poked in the air, straight back past the bowler, who nearly brushes his fingers on the ball as it thuds into the non-striker's stumps",2
6169,8.04E+11,34.2," defended with a hop into line, might have kept a bit low but clarke hammed it up a touch",2
6170,8.04E+11,34.1," clear signs of a -999-paced pitch there, the ball died on impact and clarke pulled at thin air",2
6171,8.04E+11,28.6, twinkle toes and quick wrists gets clarke a -999 to long-on. when he plays well it's a treat watching clarke play spin bowling,5
6172,8.04E+11,28.5," big sweep heaved -999 this time, all along the ground to deep square",5
6173,8.04E+11,28.4, white can't match his partner's skills and picks -999 a fielder,5
6174,8.04E+11,28.3," good follow-up, keeping the strike ticking by pushing down the ground",5
6175,8.04E+11,28.2, little bit short from the bowler and clarke wheels -999 a pull shot,5
6176,8.04E+11,28.1," this keeps a little low, and hafeez is nothing if not straight to clarke defends",5
6177,8.04E+11,23.6," this is fuller, much fuller but outside off stump and ignored by white",3
6178,8.04E+11,23.5, after the good delivery wahab serves up an easy -999 on the pads for white to clip towards square leg for a couple,3
6179,8.04E+11,23.4," wahab strikes and  australia are in trouble now! akmal takes another catch! -999 between the dross wahab has found some bounce and nibble and haddin aimed a nothing steer to third man, got a faint edge and kamran held on to the chance.",3
6180,8.04E+11,23.3," more secure this time by haddin, getting in line to defend under his eyes",3
6181,8.04E+11,23.2, haddin flashes outside off stump and misses,3
6182,8.04E+11,23.1, too short from wahab means clarke can stand tall and run down to third man,3
6183,8.04E+11,22.6," good work from clarke here, skipping down the -999 and clipping to long-on",2
6184,8.04E+11,22.5," ooh, flash and a miss outside off stump. similar to the ponting dismissal but clarke is in form so misses. such are the unwritten laws of the game",2
6185,8.04E+11,22.4, clarke whips to leg but picks -999 midwicket,2
6186,8.04E+11,22.3, good work from hafeez pinning clarke to the crease,2
6187,8.04E+11,22.2," clipped past a diving umar at midwicket, who is disgusted with himself for missing",2
6188,8.04E+11,22.1, very delicate from haddin opening the face to steer to third man. fairly ineffective though because there is a fielder there,2
6189,8.04E+11,17.6," nothing as ambitious this time from ponting, instead easing his hands over the ball to flick to leg",2
6190,8.04E+11,17.5," ah, nothing there for ponting. he wanted to squeeze a cut -999 but it was too close to him for the shot",2
6191,8.04E+11,17.4," afridi is really tossing this up, clearly feels in good control and haddin threads a -999 into space",2
6192,8.04E+11,17.3, this time haddin is more secure in defence,2
6193,8.04E+11,17.2," ooh, the pressure almost told there. attempting to run down to third man came off the bottom edge, onto the boot, very close to the stumps and almost to the keeper",2
6194,8.04E+11,17.1, no timing here for haddin as he slaps to point,2
6195,8.04E+11,12.6," australia starting to pick up the tempo now, a few quick singles making themselves available through urgent calls and calm deflections",6
6196,8.04E+11,12.5, sharp calling for a deflection into the gully,6
6197,8.04E+11,12.4, flighted and defended on off stump. good bounce in that topspinner,6
6198,8.04E+11,12.2," belted, hard and straight. not a lot of feet involved, not a lot needed. that fizzed onto the bat, and straight off again",6
6199,8.04E+11,12.1, pushed into the gap to keep the strike rotating,6
6200,8.04E+11,7.6," fenced -999 to point, and the grind continues for the aussies",2
6201,8.04E+11,7.5, back on a better line,2
6202,8.04E+11,7.5," poor ball, down the leg-side, and though it's a wide, haddin missed -999 on an easy -999 as he swept at thin air",2
6203,8.04E+11,7.4," punched into the covers, but there's nothing doing there",2
6204,8.04E+11,7.3, blocked from the crease this time. good metronomic work,2
6205,8.04E+11,7.2," haddin advances, but rehman's line is too good. forced to defend",2
6206,8.04E+11,7.1, flicked -999 to square leg,2
6207,8.04E+11,6.6, defended -999 to midwicket. another unrelentingly accurate over from gul,1
6208,8.04E+11,6.5," another slower ball, and ponting has to scamper for his ground as haddin turns down a sharp -999 in the gully. that could have been tight",1
6209,8.04E+11,6.4," on the hip, flicked fine. slim pickings so far against the wily gul",1
6210,8.04E+11,6.3," a loopy slower ball, cunningly bowled but ponting picked it early and defended",1
6211,8.04E+11,6.2," attacking off stump once again, ponting's defences are tested again",1
6212,8.04E+11,6.1," on the pads, whisked into the leg side, without much timing",1
6213,8.04E+11,2.6," banged in short, a measured pull to backward square",2
6214,8.04E+11,2.5," a very cunning slower ball, wraps his fingers round the side, and the ball dribbles past a swish and through to akmal on the fifth bounce",2
6215,8.04E+11,2.4," first signs of aggression from haddin as he gave himself room for a slap, but his shot went straight to misbah at short extra",2
6216,8.04E+11,2.3," solid line and length, defended back to the bowler",2
6217,8.04E+11,2.2," sliding into the pads, and flicked round the corner",2
6218,8.04E+11,2.1," no signs of discomfort there as gul hits his length outside off, and watson drives loosely",2
6219,8.04E+11,1.6, a hint of turn as the ball straightens on middle. solidly blocked again,5
6220,8.04E+11,1.5," defended on middle stump, solidly forward",5
6221,8.04E+11,1.4," driven hard to short midwicket, well fielded",5
6222,8.04E+11,1.3," speared down the leg side, and flicks the pad",5
6223,8.04E+11,1.2," review! watson was eyeing up those acres on the leg-side again. playing all around his front pad, and pakistan ask for a second opinion. very full length, but probably missing leg. no idea why these reviews are taking so long at the moment. just get us the pitch map. sure enough, it's an umpire's call",5
6224,8.04E+11,1.1," top strike! only -999 on the leg-side, so watson flicks gloriously, and no--999 can stop the boundary through midwicket",5
6225,8.04E+11,40.6," that's it! australia's proud undefeated run in world cups finally comes to an end. razzaq creams this through cover, calmly tucks his bat under his arm and walks off! comfortable win in the end and pakistan top the group!",9
6226,8.04E+11,40.5, just -999 hit -999 now! too short from  krejza and razzaq gets deep into his crease to haul this through midwicket for -999,9
6227,8.04E+11,40.4, open-faced steer to point gives umar a -999 and takes pakistan even closer,9
6228,8.04E+11,40.3, tossed up outside off but umar's drive is careful,9
6229,8.04E+11,40.2, driven off the back foot with the spin to mid-on,9
6230,8.04E+11,40.1," finds really huge spin from a long way outside off, caught umar by surprise but the batsman adjusted nicely to dab to point",9
6231,8.04E+11,39.6," full-pitched to finish the over. very straight too, but so was razzaq's bat",2
6232,8.04E+11,39.5, still more hostility from lee! bangs in a short ball that climbs past razzaq and crashes into haddin's gloves,2
6233,8.04E+11,39.4," slower ball, or at least the pitch made it a slower ball. umar waits, nudes to leg and jogs through",2
6234,8.04E+11,39.3, smoothly driven through cover. nine needed now and finally the heads are dropping. ponting has been stroppy all tournament and looks thoroughly annoyed at the moment,2
6235,8.04E+11,39.2," good line from lee, around off stump. razzaq drives loosely but without alarm",2
6236,8.04E+11,39.1," ooh, already he's found something that tait couldn't. it zips off the track and climbs past razzaq's outside edge",2
6237,8.04E+11,38.6," the turn and bounce beats everyone, including haddin. just jumped from a length and haddin couldn't collect cleanly",5
6238,8.04E+11,38.5, razzaq is attempting another cut and without quite timing it earns a -999 to cover,5
6239,8.04E+11,38.4, flicked firmly down the ground for a riskless -999,5
6240,8.04E+11,38.3, umar whips his bottom hand through the ball with the spin but picks -999 midwicket,5
6241,8.04E+11,38.2," better this time, guiding the ball with a straight bat to cover",5
6242,8.04E+11,38.1," ooh, bottom-edge lands close to the stumps but razzaq survives",5
6243,8.04E+11,10.6, watson finds something close to off stump but younis seemed to have an age to ease forward and defend,6
6244,8.04E+11,10.5," another gimme served up on the pads, flicked -999 to deep square",6

6897,8.04E+11,1.1," round the -999, on off stump and defended",0
6898,8.04E+11,36.6, tucked off his pads so he keeps the strike,9
6899,8.04E+11,36.5," there it is, a brilliant hundred for dilshan...another cut shot brings him the boundary he needed, this time it was placed with the power to beat the infield. a moment to savour for dilshan who is having a wonderful tournament",9
6900,8.04E+11,36.4, steps back and cuts between cover and backward point...dilshan still quick between the wickets,9
6901,8.04E+11,36.3, defended back to the bowler,9
6902,8.04E+11,36.2, worked down to long on,9
6903,8.04E+11,36.1, down the pitch to a full toss and driven to long off,9
6904,8.04E+11,35.6, doesn't time this pull as he rolls to mid-on,6
6905,8.04E+11,35.5, lovely shot as he angles the bat down to third man when offered some width...nice piece of footwork stops the boundary,6
6906,8.04E+11,35.4, dragged down short on leg stump and it's pulled easily to fine leg,6
6907,8.04E+11,35.3, back of a length and it's pulled into midwicket without much timing,6
6908,8.04E+11,35.2, comes half forward and it finds an inside edge to deep square-leg,6
6909,8.04E+11,35.1, whipped from around off stump wide of mid-on,6
6910,8.04E+11,23.6," swing into tharanga this time, veered towards the pads but the leg-side flick was missed.",2
6911,8.04E+11,23.5, good delivery again here. fuller and a hint of movement -999. tharanga solid in defence,2
6912,8.04E+11,23.4, pace and bounce climbs past a groping outside edge,2
6913,8.04E+11,23.3, enough width on offer again for dilshan to flash -999 to deep point,2
6914,8.04E+11,23.2, better delivery here around off stump and dilshan carves to point,2
6915,8.04E+11,23.1," starts with a horrid ball, dragged short and wide outside off. dilshan missed a cut for no good reason",2
6916,8.04E+11,19.6, worked into the leg side,7
6917,8.04E+11,19.5, driven off the back foot into the covers,7
6918,8.04E+11,19.4, swept into bell at short leg who premeditated the shot and was skipping around from his position then it flies -999 to square leg,7
6919,8.04E+11,19.3, down the pitch and drills a drive to short cover,7
6920,8.04E+11,19.2, comes forward and pushes to backward point,7
6921,8.04E+11,19.1," beaten by a beauty, but it goes for -999 byes as it spins between bat and pad then beats matt prior",7
6922,8.04E+11,18.6," that's nicely done, it may have looked streaky but he was in control of the strike as he opened the face and guided down to third man well wide of the line slip",7
6923,8.04E+11,18.5, brings -999 the pull against this short ball and helps it down to long leg,7
6924,8.04E+11,18.4, banged in short outside off and it loops gently through to prior,7
6925,8.04E+11,18.3," full outside off, driven -999 to deep cover",7
6926,8.04E+11,18.2, takes the pad behind square on the leg side,7
6927,8.04E+11,18.1," starts well on middle stump, dilshan defends into the off side",7
6928,8.04E+11,8.6," this was hit even harder, but straight to point. strauss immediately calls for a change at tremlett's end",10
6929,8.04E+11,8.5, sri lanka are flying now! fifty stand as tremlett dishes up some filth short and wide outside off and it's crashed to the point boundary,10
6930,8.04E+11,8.4," much better ball, fuller and straight. dilshan offers utmost respect in defence",10
6931,8.04E+11,8.3," not the place to bowl, shortish of a good length sits up asking for trouble. dilshan hangs back and swishes to square leg",10
6932,8.04E+11,8.2, this time dilshan doesn't miss -999. this isn't actually a half-volley but dilshan backed himself to thrash through the covers and got all of it,10
6933,8.04E+11,8.1," somehow tremlett has got -999 with this, floating up a half-volley that dilshan carves to cover",10
6934,8.04E+11,0.6, solid finish to a solid opening over from bresnan. back of a length and defended,2
6935,8.04E+11,0.5, bresnan loses his line and it thuds off the pads past prior leaving a knackered jonathan trott to scoot round from fine leg and cut off inside the rope,2
6936,8.04E+11,0.4, shape back into tharanga from back of a length. defended to cover. in the meantime england have a pop at dilshan who is full of chat in response,2
6937,8.04E+11,0.3," tharanga is desperately seeking room outside off, gets the slightest hint and crashes to point",2
6938,8.04E+11,0.2," swing again, from bat and ball and it's a play and miss outside off stump. tharanga aiming another cut shot",2
6939,8.04E+11,0.1, swing first up! actual swing. comes back to tharanga as he aims to cut and cramps him for room,2
6940,8.04E+11,48.5," all over in a heap for new zealand. innings end with a -999 for -999 collapse as mckay prods hopelessly and misses. murali waves his cap to the crowds as he leads sri lanka off, they'll hope not to see him later!",1
6941,8.04E+11,48.4," goodness, by the looks of things mckay is no no. 12. gropes aimlessly at this as it sneaks past the edge",1
6942,8.04E+11,48.3," southee gone now, things sliding -999 in a hurry. spun -999 again and southee was very tentative, prodding at the ball, faint outside edge and sangakkara does the rest",1
6943,8.04E+11,48.2," big spin this -999 from the bat, southee looks curiously at it and can only poke to cover",1
6944,8.04E+11,48.1," vettori again on an awkward sweep, bounced a touch more than he expected and ended up shovelling towards midwicket",1
6945,8.04E+11,45.6, excellent slower yorker to finish that oram carefully digs -999 back to the bowler,6
6946,8.04E+11,45.5, not quite the big heave to the boundary but an outside edge will do! full and a half-open-face half-edge scoots off to the third man boundary,6
6947,8.04E+11,45.4, slower ball that styris slugs down the ground. he's hardly had any strike of late,6
6948,8.04E+11,45.3," full toss again, clipped straight to midwicket, oram makes a tight -999 easy by virtue of his enormous strides",6
6949,8.04E+11,45.2, swinging low full-toss to greet the new batsman. oram opens the face to steer behind square but picks -999 point,6
6950,8.04E+11,45.1," malinga is such a demon at the end of an innings. brilliant variations! mccullum stepped down looking to heave to leg, slight slower ball meant he was through the shot too early and found a faint top edge",6
6951,8.04E+11,42.6, this spins back a long way but williamson was quick enough on his feet to get outside the line and give himself room to squeeze a back-foot drive,10
6952,8.04E+11,42.5, this time it's flipped to leg but straight to the man,10
6953,8.04E+11,42.4," -999 more! too short, really sat up and williamson hopped back and chopped a cut shot firmly behind point",10
6954,8.04E+11,42.3," wonderful shot! shot of the day -999 reckon! williamson dances down the track and gives himself room to unfurl a very controlled, chip-drive over mid-off and it speeds -999 for -999",10
6955,8.04E+11,42.2, this is flatter and spins sharply enough to make williamson uncomfortable in defence,10
6956,8.04E+11,42.1, murali begins his new spell by floating up a full ball that is carefully pushed for a -999 down the ground,10
6957,8.04E+11,40.6," careful defence to end the over. these -999 can probably 'just bat', as the clichã© goes, for another -999 or -999 overs before beginning the charge. that said, swatting malinga for many at the death is not straightforward",4
6958,8.04E+11,40.5, williamson finds some space to squeeze a cut behind point,4
6959,8.04E+11,40.4, pushed down the ground firmly,4
6960,8.04E+11,40.3," williamson pops this into the off side and steals a tight -999 that has styris sprawling over the line, flat on his face and covered in dirt",4
6961,8.04E+11,40.2, this time the delicate drive is wide of the bowler and styris collects a very well-complied 50,4
6962,8.04E+11,40.1, 10 overs to go and styris begins the charge by defending back to the bowler,4
6963,8.04E+11,33.6, sturdy defence to finish. could be malinga's spell -999 reckon,2
6964,8.04E+11,33.5, just -999 deliveries left before the ball changes and the swing goes -999. styris calmly blocks to long-on,2
6965,8.04E+11,33.4, styris grits his teeth and jabs -999 another searing yorker towards cover,2
6966,8.04E+11,33.3," slower ball almost gets the better of taylor, who adjusts late but not enough to prevent a slight leading edge that squirts to cover",2
6967,8.04E+11,33.2," full and swinging in again, you know what's coming, just the playing it bit that's harder",2
6968,8.04E+11,33.1, full and straight and lurking swing back into the batsman who digs it -999,2
6969,8.04E+11,27.6," nudged just wide of midwicket, they steal another quick -999",4
6970,8.04E+11,27.5," taylor hangs back and punches, herath dives but can't stop it and they take -999 as the ball rolls down to long off",4
6971,8.04E+11,27.4, driven down to long off,4
6972,8.04E+11,27.3," full again, he adjusts his line well and styris drives back to the bowler",4
6973,8.04E+11,27.3," loopy full toss, wide of off, and styris misses the drive ... that looked like herath's variation, the -999 he flicks -999 that spins the other way - carrom ball",4
6974,8.04E+11,27.2, defended to cover,4
6975,8.04E+11,27.1," huge shout first ball as styris, who is in a cap now, misses a sweep and is struck on the pad. hitting outside off though, no review called for",4
6976,8.04E+11,12.6," too wide again from matthews, but it's closer to a yorker length so ryder can't get the elevation he got last time",7
6977,8.04E+11,12.5," -999 more! top work from ryder, offered some width and ryder eases his arms gently through the ball sending it over cover and speeding to the rope",7
6978,8.04E+11,12.4," matthews is bowling offspinners here! tossed up and cutting -999, ryder has to drive in slow motion",7
6979,8.04E+11,12.3," another open face, much slower ball and guptill had to wait in position for a late cut for a long, long time before it slides off the face",7
6980,8.04E+11,12.2," wristy, open-face steer sends this down to third man",7
6981,8.04E+11,12.1," matthews continues and guptill's full-face, in-the-v drive is unfurled again. just for a -999 though because long-on is in place",7
6982,8.04E+11,9.6, very straight ball finds a very straight bat,1
6983,8.04E+11,9.5, slightly quicker here and ryder pops forward to defend,1
6984,8.04E+11,9.4," ooh, ryder misreads this and plays outside of it a fraction as it spins back to him. went uppishly back to mendis",1
6985,8.04E+11,9.3," nicely done from the batsman, playing it late and straight down the ground",1
6986,8.04E+11,9.2, this is heading to middle before guptill eases into line to block,1
6987,8.04E+11,9.1," starts straight, he's always straight. guptill flashes a drive straight to cover",1
6988,8.04E+11,3.6," excellent over, maiden no less. finishes with some spin again nothing for mccullum to get hold of",0
6989,8.04E+11,3.5, much quicker here and mccullum jabs down in a rush,0
6990,8.04E+11,3.4, spin! proper turn here squared mccullum up. herath holding it back a touch and finding good purchase as a result,0
6991,8.04E+11,3.3," slider, slightly quicker and mccullum hurries his defence",0
6992,8.04E+11,3.2, hint of false shot as some spin finds the outer half of the bat,0
6993,8.04E+11,3.1, herath loops this up a touch and finds some spin as a result. quietly defended,0
6994,8.04E+11,33.6," tossed up and sangakkara rushes down the track to meet it, almost ends up yorking himself. vettori almost has a spring in his step! he's been rather grumpy most of the day",1
6995,8.04E+11,33.5," sprawling, diving stop from nathan mccullum at mid-off saves a boundary from crisp drive",1
6996,8.04E+11,33.4," more solid this time, samaraweera steps forward to block",1
6997,8.04E+11,33.3, hint of air and spin and samaraweera is cagey in defence,1
6998,8.04E+11,33.2, goodness me! this zips through past the inside edge of a nervous poke outside off,1
6999,8.04E+11,33.1," well, well. -999 silence in the crowds as jayawardene is given -999 lbw. he popped forward to a straight delivery, played around a straight ball and was struck in front. decent stride and a review but the ball is hitting!",1
7000,8.04E+11,30.6," southee ends a superb over with another accurate length delivery, which sangakkara nudges into the leg side",0
7001,8.04E+11,30.5," was that the chance? slower ball from southee, pitched up, and sangakkara mis-reads it, popping the ball back in the air ... but the luck is with him, it goes wide of the bowler who tries to swivel across in his follow-through",0
7002,8.04E+11,30.4," not yet, again southee hits a length on off stump and sangakkara nudges to point",0
7003,8.04E+11,30.3," a touch straighter, this time sangakkara nudges to midwicket. this has been a good over so far. big shot coming?",0
7004,8.04E+11,30.2," good length from southee, and he's found a nice line on off stump, giving sangakkara no width. pushed to mid-off this time",0
7005,8.04E+11,30.1," southee continues, sangakkara punching -999 to point",0
7006,8.04E+11,24.6," sangakkara jumps -999 of the crease, turning the delivery into a full toss and thwacking it to the deep midwicket boundary!",6
7007,8.04E+11,24.5," a touch to full on leg stump, nudged to the man at midwicket",6
7008,8.04E+11,24.4," quality ball from mccullum, pitching on middle and spinning -999. sangakkara treats it with respect, defending solidly",6
7009,8.04E+11,24.3," sangakkara looks for the little dink into the leg side, but the ball goes nowhere",6
7010,8.04E+11,24.2," mccullum comes round the -999 to dilshan, who thumps a full ball down to long-on for a -999",6
7011,8.04E+11,24.1," tossed up on the toes, sangakkara just places the ball to square leg for an easy -999",6
7012,8.04E+11,22.6," tapped towards mid-off, who is a little deep, and they sprint through for a quick -999",7
7013,8.04E+11,22.5," driven in the air! but sangakkara threads the gap at extra cover perfectly, and that was powerfully struck too",7
7014,8.04E+11,22.4," back of a length on off stump, pushed firmly back to the bowler",7
7015,8.04E+11,22.3, fielding! new zealand enhance their reputation as a fielding unit even further as how leaps to his right at cover point to stop another scything drive from sangakkara,7
7016,8.04E+11,22.3," very short indeed from mckay, the ball balloons miles over the batsman and that's definitely a wide",7
7017,8.04E+11,22.2," definite wobble through the air for mckay as he pitches -999 up on off stump. sangakkara responds with a stylish square drive, but it's stopped by ryder at point",7
7018,8.04E+11,22.1," full on off stump, cracked -999 through the covers by dilshan",7
7019,8.04E+11,20.6," back of a length to finish, sangakkara defends off the splice of the bat to cover",4
7020,8.04E+11,20.5," bouncer from mckay, and a good -999. sangakkara is a cool customer, however, and buckles his knees in good time",4
7021,8.04E+11,20.4," a touch of extra bounce outside off, but there's also some width. sangakkara can't take full toll, however, tapping to backward point",4
7022,8.04E+11,20.3," fuller, wobbling around on off stump and sangakkara comes forward to defend to the off side",4
7023,8.04E+11,20.2," mckay responds by digging this -999 in much shorter, sangakkara steps back and defends infront of his chest",4
7024,8.04E+11,20.1," that is all class from sangakkara, leaning forward with perfect balance and aiming a checked-drive straight down the ground. the ball really pinged off the middle, timed to perfection",4
7025,8.04E+11,18.6," on a length and straight to finish, dilshan pushes to mid-on. a maiden for mckay, new zealand need to string a couple of them together and build some pressure",0
7026,8.04E+11,18.5," quick and full on off stump, dilshan stands still and flashes to point. he just can't beat this field",0
7027,8.04E+11,18.4," slower ball this time, an offcutter, and again dilshan pushes into the off side. not many gaps in this field",0
7028,8.04E+11,18.3," dug in short by mckay, dilshan slaps down on the ball but can't beat cover",0
7029,8.04E+11,18.2," straighter this time, nudged defensively into the leg side",0
7030,8.04E+11,18.1," good line from mckay, the ball spitting off a length to beat the outside edge",0
7031,8.04E+11,17.6," very full once again, sangakkara leans into a drive but perhaps tries to over-hit it, and the shot goes nowhere",3
7032,8.04E+11,17.5," tossed up, defended by sangakkara",3
7033,8.04E+11,17.4," extra bounce again from vettori, but dilshan steps back and punches to cover for a -999 this time. a less aggressive shot than the last",3
7034,8.04E+11,17.3," 'catch!' shouts vettori as dilshan cuts and is very nearly beaten by the extra bounce, the ball looping towards backward point but dropping in front of him. that was close",3
7035,8.04E+11,17.2," kumar wanders -999 of his crease, taking the ball on the half volley and sending it down to long-on",3
7036,8.04E+11,17.1," great delivery after the break, but it's safely negotiated. looped up on middle, gripping and spinning -999, but dilshan nudges it down behind gully for -999 all the same",3
7037,8.04E+11,16.6," fuller ball to end the over, dilshan works it -999 to mid on.",3
7038,8.04E+11,16.5, holds this -999 back of a length and sanga gets inside the line to glance a -999 backward of square leg,3
7039,8.04E+11,16.4," very optimistic appeal from mckay, but he's working up some pace now. 143 kph and prodigious inward movement on that from over the -999, hit sanga's toes on the move as he missed the flick, but it was going well down the leg side",3
7040,8.04E+11,16.3," short of a length on middle, sanga's behind the line as he defends down the track.",3
7041,8.04E+11,16.2," mckay gets -999 to come in off the seam. or was that reverse? 142 kph as sanga punches from the crease to mid off. dilshan wants a -999, and has to hurry back in as mid off struggles to pick it",3
7042,8.04E+11,16.1, ryder's on the move once again. he's horizontal at point after throwing himself into the path of a spanking dilshan square drive as mckay angles -999 across full and wide.,3
7043,8.04E+11,10.6," back of a length delivery outside off, this is a watchful start from sanga as he steers past point for a -999.",4
7044,8.04E+11,10.5," short of a length and angling across, sanga opens the face and steers to point",4
7045,8.04E+11,10.4," full length ball on leg stump, sanga works it off the toes to the leg side.",4
7046,8.04E+11,10.3," fuller length, angling across and sanga pushes with the angle to the off side",4
7047,8.04E+11,10.2," back of a length on leg stump, sanga covers the line and defends to the leg side",4
7048,8.04E+11,10.1," where is slip? sanga is let off, as oram gets another -999 to nip -999 off the seam and he is sucked into a loose cover drive. the ball duly takes the edge and flies fine, but baz is standing up and the slip is not there.",4
7049,8.04E+11,9.6," short of a length ball on off stump, dilshan gets a half stride in and defends into the covers.",1
7050,8.04E+11,9.5," aha, southee gets the bouncer on target this time and dilshan was caught amidships. short, fast and aimed at the helmet. dilshan was expecting a fuller ball, and then had to hurry onto the back foot. dilshan being dilshan, he even tried to pull it -999, but missed. it grazed the helmet on the way to the keeper.",1
7051,8.04E+11,9.4," back of a length outside off, dilshan jumps back and forces into the covers",1
7052,8.04E+11,9.3," length ball, comes in and cramps dilshan who defends against the angle into the off side",1
7053,8.04E+11,9.2," on the pads, sanga stays back and clips through midwicket for a -999.",1
7054,8.04E+11,9.1," length ball from southee on off stump, sanga defends carefully",1
7055,8.04E+11,2.6," over-pitched on leg stump, tharanga squeezes it -999 to the leg side of the pitch",2
7056,8.04E+11,2.5," the compensation, nathan drops too short and tharanga has too much time on his hands to place it well. he cuts straight to cover.",2
7057,8.04E+11,2.4," he's not very keen to spend much time inside the crease. tharanga gambols -999, nathan keeps it short of a length and tharanga still scythes it with the spin towards wide mid off",2
7058,8.04E+11,2.3," fullish ball on leg, tharanga defends from the crease.",2
7059,8.04E+11,2.2," smartly bowled from round the -999, full and drifting -999 from dilshan who has to adjust after reaching across. he opens the face and dabs to point for a -999.",2
7060,8.04E+11,2.1," flat delivery on middle and breaking in, dilshan works it with the turn to the leg side for no runs",2
7061,8.04E+11,43.6," riaz steams in from round the -999 to bhajji, banging this -999 in fairly short. it spits up, going with the angle towards leg stump and strikes the batsman on the hip, looping towards short fine leg. bhajji was looking for the paddle-pull but couldn't connect",6

7224,8.04E+11,40.2, around the off stump line. pushed -999 to long-off for a -999,2
7225,8.04E+11,40.1," goes back to push this off break, delivered from round the stumps, to cover",2
7226,8.04E+11,39.6," slower, outside off stump, cut to point. misfield. then an overthrow. the wheels are threatening to come off here. they need some inspiration. can malinga do some magic?",11
7227,8.04E+11,39.5," flighted outside off on a length, dhoni works it past square-leg. they think about the second. both rush for the first run but dhoni slips on the second. gautam sees that and retreats",11
7228,8.04E+11,39.4, moves over the stumps. dhoni lunges forward to defend to the on side,11
7229,8.04E+11,39.3, crashed! it was a overpitched delivery outside off and dhoni gets forward to smash-drive it to wide long-off boundary.,11
7230,8.04E+11,39.3," flighted outside leg, from round the stumps, dhoni misses the sweep. 100 of the partnership is up. what a icy-cool partnership it has been",11
7231,8.04E+11,39.2," on the pads, nudged through to fine-leg region and before malinga can stop that, they get -999",11
7232,8.04E+11,39.1," wide outside off, slow through the air, gambhir reaches -999 to cut but mistimes the shot. a -999 nevertheless",11
7233,8.04E+11,37.6," fifty up. no celebrations so far. not even a smile. now, slowly he raises his bat. it was a shortish delivery outside off and dhoni jumped -999 at the width. he crashed it through extra cover.",8
7234,8.04E+11,37.5, slip in place. gautam dabs it to vacant midwicket for a -999. 200 up and crowd roar.,8
7235,8.04E+11,37.4," flights this -999 up around off, full, driven -999 to long-off for a -999",8
7236,8.04E+11,37.3," presses back, waits for the ball to arrive and punches it wide of sweeper cover for couple of runs",8
7237,8.04E+11,37.2," doosra just outside leg, full. dhoni tries to play the chappati shot, tries to play the vertical sweep almost behind the keeper and edges it to his pad",8
7238,8.04E+11,37.1," from round the stumps, on the middle, turned to midwicket",8
7239,8.04E+11,35.6," quicker, again gambhir backs -999 and this time cuts from middle to cover",8
7240,8.04E+11,35.5," around the off stump, gautam goes back, gets outside leg, creates room and cuts to point",8
7241,8.04E+11,35.4," from round the stumps, just outside off stump, punched -999 to deep cover",8
7242,8.04E+11,35.3, presses back to punch this to right of sweeper cover for -999 runs.,8
7243,8.04E+11,35.2, whack! crowd roar. indian flags dance. it was a short of length delivery outside off and dhoni slaps it to the cover point boundary. thump,8
7244,8.04E+11,35.1," flighted from round the stumps, driven to long-off for a -999",8
7245,8.04E+11,33.6," straighter -999 outside off, punched -999 to sweeper cover",5
7246,8.04E+11,33.5, lunges forward and across to defend to the off and it runs off the edge to the leg side,5
7247,8.04E+11,33.4," on the off stump line, pushed to left of cover for a -999.",5
7248,8.04E+11,33.3," paddles this -999 to fine-leg and once they see its murali, they sprint back for the second",5
7249,8.04E+11,33.2," lovely delivery; slow through the air, flighted outside off, on a length inviting a drive and gmbhir squirts it to backward point",5
7250,8.04E+11,33.1," on the middle and off, nurdled around to square-leg and they take the run",5
7251,8.04E+11,26.6," again he goes for the yorker, this -999 becomes a low full toss, though, as malinga doesn't quite get the length right, and gambhir works it to leg",6
7252,8.04E+11,26.5," another good yorker but gambhir has got a boundary from it! he's jammed the bat down on this -999, which is just outside off stump, and gambhir gets a thick edge -999 through the vacant cordon",6
7253,8.04E+11,26.4," nice shot, as dhoni drives through cover point",6
7254,8.04E+11,26.3," good line! that action, and the little bit of late swing in, makes it very important that dhoni gets the bat back down very quickly, which he does and defends",6
7255,8.04E+11,26.2," malinga kisses the ball and runs in, sends down a good yorker that is well driven square by gambhir, he's done well to get that -999, but there's a man at deep point",6
7256,8.04E+11,26.1," immediately the pace is difficult, and gambhir just clunks the ball down into the turf",6
7257,8.04E+11,3.6," kula bends -999 in from back of a length, sachin waits and forces to the off side",11
7258,8.04E+11,3.5," another corker from sachin. the first really loose ball of the night, just short enough and wide enough outside off for sachin to pounce on with the cut. enough to beat point moving to his left and third man to his right.",11
7259,8.04E+11,3.4," kapu has saved a -999 at point. sachin climbs into an on-the-up square drive and times it well, but kapu pulls it down with a dive.",11
7260,8.04E+11,3.3," oh boy. we have seen some delightful shots today, and looks like we aren't done. any doubts over who makes sachin's bat? just look at that replay for he shows the full face for a full couple of seconds. short of a length on middle and off, sachin leans -999 and meets it on top of the bounce and powers it past kula.",11
7261,8.04E+11,3.2," sachin threads the covers again. dextrous. kula sends down the legcutter on off stump and sachin sees it nipping -999, he waits and opens the face to get -999 more between cover and point.",11
7262,8.04E+11,3.1," full length ball on off stump, he quietly pushes to mid off for -999",11
7263,8.04E+11,41.6, worked past a diving midwicket for -999 into the deep,3
7264,8.04E+11,41.5," short, ripped across the batsman and well taken down the leg side by akmal who launches into a shrieking appeal for the catch behind., nothing doing from bowden, although he doesn't signal the  wide so acknowledging that it hit something on its way through",3
7265,8.04E+11,41.4, clipped right to midwicket,3
7266,8.04E+11,41.3, punched to inzamam at extra cover,3
7267,8.04E+11,41.2, bravo punches the ball into the leg side and is off the mark straight -999,3
7268,8.04E+11,41.1," lara looks to sweep from outside the off stump and akmal holds a thin edge. lara doesn't wait for the decision, sharply turning and heading off as akmal, who has had another mixed day, celebrates",3
7269,8.04E+11,30.6," a huge, but lone, appeal from akmal for a stumping - sharp work from the keeper but samuels's foot was grounded",14
7270,8.04E+11,30.5," ah, samuels's aggression getting the better of him and he was nearly a gonner then, rushing a drive, but getting an edge which runs -999 through third man. the batsman was -999 of his crease - he could have been stumped",14
7271,8.04E+11,30.4," that's just beasted high and far over long-on, down the track and elegantly whipped -999, we liked that -999, too",14
7272,8.04E+11,30.3, same ball and kaneria shies at the striker's end this time,14
7273,8.04E+11,30.2," samuels taking kaneria on, hitting it right back to him, bump ball, and the bowler tidies that -999 up",14
7274,8.04E+11,30.1, straight - and true - drive made to look very easy; struck cleanly against the spin and you've got to love that -999,14
7275,8.04E+11,27.6," short and heaved through midwicket - the least attractive shot of the over, but effective",14
7276,8.04E+11,27.5, lara pushes the ball to mid-on and is off the mark - to a big cheer - after 13 balls,14
7277,8.04E+11,27.4," lara back and up on his toes, he runs the ball to cover where it is well fielded",14
7278,8.04E+11,27.3, short and samuels swivels to pull the ball to long leg,14
7279,8.04E+11,27.2," and again, once more hit on the up, this time over extra cover and it races to the extra-cover rope. -999 half volleys, ten runs",14
7280,8.04E+11,27.1, samuels frees his arms and thumps the ball high over the bowler's head. it was in the slot and it was really smacked,14
7281,8.04E+11,20.6," really good over to open up, all -999 balls forcing the batsman to play and also putting doubt in his mind with -999 that really ripped past the outside edge",0
7282,8.04E+11,20.5," good, tight bowling once more",0
7283,8.04E+11,20.4," another -999 right where it matters, samuels can do no more than cautiously defend",0
7284,8.04E+11,20.3," on the spot, pushed defensively into the off side",0
7285,8.04E+11,20.2, squirted to backward point. kaneria right on the button,0
7286,8.04E+11,20.1," good start, turned past a lunge outside off stump",0
7287,8.04E+11,14.6, worked down to third man,6
7288,8.04E+11,14.5, straighter and that's quickly latched on to in front of point,6
7289,8.04E+11,14.4, left alone outside off this time,6
7290,8.04E+11,14.3, driven through cover where shoaib malik does the honours,6
7291,8.04E+11,14.2," managed to get his pad -999 of the way, account for the swing, and that's worked behind square and that's the fifty up",6
7292,8.04E+11,14.1, worked off the back foot into cover,6
7293,8.04E+11,11.6," on the money again, another dot, and another maiden in fact",0
7294,8.04E+11,11.5, rushes that -999 down the channel and that's easily left. this is some good bowling by the pakistan pair - keep that up and the pressure will soon be building,0
7295,8.04E+11,11.4," pushed up there, just outside off, and chanderpaul plays it down well, off the back foot and taking the pace right off as he steers it into gully",0
7296,8.04E+11,11.3, worked down off the back foot into the covers,0
7297,8.04E+11,11.2," good delivery now from rao, moving -999 from the lefthander's outside edge - chanderpaul played at that -999",0
7298,8.04E+11,11.1, works that with soft hands straight to the man at midwicket and there's not even a hint of a -999 on,0
7299,8.04E+11,4.6, chanderpaul back and into line. a good over spoiled by kaneria's moment of madness,4
7300,8.04E+11,4.5, another defensive jab into the covers,4
7301,8.04E+11,4.4, pushed into the off side. inzamam is still fuming and kaneria looks as if he wants to be anywhere but -999 in the middle,4
7302,8.04E+11,4.3," kaneria earns a hard stare from his captain and rightly so. chanderpaul pushed to short extra cover, kaneria picked it up and hurled it about -999 feet over a bemused akmal's head for -999 overthrows",4
7303,8.04E+11,4.2," full, through a half-hearted shot and a stifled appeal but the ball pitched outside the leg stump",4
7304,8.04E+11,4.1, angled across chanderpaul who doesn't want to know and leaves it well alone,4
7305,8.04E+11,46.6, you won't see many better catches than that! a full toss driven firmly back to the left of bravo who stuck -999 a hand and held the ball at full stretch no more than 18 inches above the ground in his follow through. a jubilant bravo sprints into the deep pursued by team-mates ...,3
7306,8.04E+11,46.5, iftikhar chips a full toss from a slower delivery to lara at extra cover where he takes the catch high above his head,3
7307,8.04E+11,46.4," athletic stop diving to his right by bravo, changing direction in his follow through",3
7308,8.04E+11,46.3, slow by slower ball standards - 57mph which is shy of monty panesar speed - and driven backward of point,3
7309,8.04E+11,46.2, up to long-on as the crowd get ready to party,3
7310,8.04E+11,46.1, shoaib forced to do a fast-shoe shuffle by a yorker speared in at his feet,3
7311,8.04E+11,41.6," banged in, that got big on iftikhar who was struck a painful blow on the collar bone  and made no attempt to hide the fact that it hurt as he staggered -999",9
7312,8.04E+11,41.5, prodded into the leg side,9
7313,8.04E+11,41.4," in the slot, heaved over cow corner for a big -999. that went over the rope and more",9
7314,8.04E+11,41.3," comedy running - a yorker dug -999 into the off side, shoaib started running, iftikhar  stayed put and then set off just as shoaib started back. in the end sarwan, running in from cover, just had to hit from 10 yards but missed by an inch",9
7315,8.04E+11,41.2," angled down the leg side, flicked to deep square leg",9
7316,8.04E+11,41.1, driven on the half volley to mid-on,9
7317,8.04E+11,32.6," driven easily to cover, brushing off the pressure like swatting a fly",5
7318,8.04E+11,32.5," ...no he can't because he's gone! akmal slashed low to gully and that's a fantastic catch. smith on a hat-trick now, no pressure then for naved",5
7319,8.04E+11,32.4," inducker and that's as plumb as you like - and smith certainly does like - whooping as taufel raises the finger. hawk-eye suggests that the ball may have been going over, but inzamam is on his way and this could be the turning point",5
7320,8.04E+11,32.3, right up there and that's nudged down quietly into the covers,5
7321,8.04E+11,32.2, improvised pull shot tucked off the hips and swivelled to midwicket,5
7322,8.04E+11,32.1, shot! moves back to give himself room and then steps elegantly into that aerial extra-cover drive which nearly carries for a clean -999. it's a clean -999 instead,5
7323,8.04E+11,28.6," yousuf goes to smith's obvious delight. a little short, the ball climbed on him and seamed back in, cramping him for room and an outside edge spat through to ramdin to give him his third catch of the innings. pakistan were cruising ... now they have work to do",2
7324,8.04E+11,28.5, again the crowd roar their approval as yousuf makes things hard for himself outside the off stump,2
7325,8.04E+11,28.4," yousuf takes a step down the track and across to the off, shaping to flick to the leg  side, and is almost bowled rounds his legs",2
7326,8.04E+11,28.3, this time inzamam finds space,2
7327,8.04E+11,28.2, square drive well fielded at backward point by a leaping bravo,2
7328,8.04E+11,28.1," worked up to long-on, ambled -999, ambled fielding, all very subdued as is often the case in the middle stages of a -999-day innings",2
7329,8.04E+11,27.6, placed down to third man,5
7330,8.04E+11,27.5," into the covers, never a -999",5
7331,8.04E+11,27.4, turned behind square on the leg side,5
7332,8.04E+11,27.3," square drive, inzamam wanted the second but yousuf was having none of it and he sent his captain back",5
7333,8.04E+11,27.2, square drive and this time samuels has to make 20 yards to his left to make a tumbling stop on the cover boundary. how on earth did they manage to just -999 run there?,5
7334,8.04E+11,27.1, crisp off drive but only -999 as there is a man in the deep. there might have been -999 had there been a different pair at the crease,5
7335,8.04E+11,25.6, turned down to long leg where powell fields,4
7336,8.04E+11,25.5, worked to the man deep at square leg,4
7337,8.04E+11,25.4, once more yousuf shuffles across his stumps and flicks to midwicket,4
7338,8.04E+11,25.3, driven off his toes right to midwicket who is in quickly to prevent a -999,4
7339,8.04E+11,25.2," inzamam back, thumps the ball to long-on and chugs the -999",4
7340,8.04E+11,25.1, loosener driven through the covers to the sweeper,4
7341,8.04E+11,23.6," hit uppishly down to long leg, no chance of a catch but not really controlled",6
7342,8.04E+11,23.5, inzamam looks to cut but plays over the ball,6
7343,8.04E+11,23.4," no run again, he once more finds the fielder",6
7344,8.04E+11,23.3, angled drive right to cover,6
7345,8.04E+11,23.2," -999 step and swatted off middle stump over midwicket and to the rope. so easy, so effortless ...",6
7346,8.04E+11,23.1, crisp drive into the covers,6
7347,8.04E+11,22.6," pushed to cover, only -999 off the over",3
7348,8.04E+11,22.5," yousuf waits and works into the leg side, dropping it into space",3
7349,8.04E+11,22.4, into space on the leg side this time,3
7350,8.04E+11,22.3, cracked to mid-on who makes a good stop. inzamam looks scornfully at his bat as if it and not he was to blame for not finding the gap,3
7351,8.04E+11,22.2," inzamam shuffles across to the off side, so far that he ends up having to pad it as he can't get his bat round his front leg",3
7352,8.04E+11,22.1, slashed down to third man,3
7353,8.04E+11,20.6, flicked off his hips to deep backward square leg,2
7354,8.04E+11,20.5, driven with an open face between cover and extra cover to the man patrolling in the deep,2
7355,8.04E+11,20.4, inzamam meets another straight -999 with a dead bat,2
7356,8.04E+11,20.3, blocked on off stump. the rate is now over -999 for the first time,2
7357,8.04E+11,20.2," solid block, almost with exaggerated caution",2
7358,8.04E+11,20.1," slightly short, inzamam shapes to pull but mistimes it and bottom-edges it into his midriff without any sign of distress",2
7359,8.04E+11,16.6," bravo into action again, picking up another punched drive",8
7360,8.04E+11,16.5," again hit firmly but once more he finds the fielder, this time bravo at extra cover",8
7361,8.04E+11,16.4, big stride forward and punched to mid-off,8
7362,8.04E+11,16.3," an even better stroke, driven in a classic fashion between mid-off and extra cover for -999. lovely shot and whatever he had at the drinks interval, -999 want some ...",8
7363,8.04E+11,16.2, short and inzamam on it like a shot to pull for -999. silence around the ground ...,8
7364,8.04E+11,16.1," driven to the left of chanderpaul at mid-off and he leaps to make a superb stop, and the batsmen were briefly all at sea but both made it home",8
7365,8.04E+11,14.6, on the money and defended into the on-side,1
7366,8.04E+11,14.5, defended down off the back foot into the covers,1
7367,8.04E+11,14.4, attempted on-drive rolls straight to the fielder who deals with it without alarm,1
7368,8.04E+11,14.3, worked off the hips to mid-on without much power,1
7369,8.04E+11,14.2, driven to cover,1
7370,8.04E+11,14.1," pitches outside off, moves into the batsman, quite short, and that's worked into midwicket, pretty easily, off the hips",1
7371,8.04E+11,13.6, drives that without much power into the covers,0
7372,8.04E+11,13.5, defended forward this time,0
7373,8.04E+11,13.4, nibbled just in front of point,0
7374,8.04E+11,13.3, worked into midwicket this time,0
7375,8.04E+11,13.2," on the spot again and inzamam looks to drive that straight, but eases -999 of the shot",0
7376,8.04E+11,13.1, defended on the front foot and that rolls to cover,0
7377,8.04E+11,8.6, another quick -999 to end the over and yet again yousuf nicks the strike,3
7378,8.04E+11,8.5," ooh, aah... a misdirected ball, wide, and that's a great piece of fielding by dwayne smith in the gully, who had to pounce low to his left after a crashing cut",3
7379,8.04E+11,8.4, quick -999,3
7380,8.04E+11,8.3, left alone outside off,3
7381,8.04E+11,8.2, defended off the back foot and squirted into the cover region,3
7382,8.04E+11,8.1," short, just to say on leg, and that's turned -999 behind square for some easy run action",3
7383,8.04E+11,7.6," outside off, the batsman shapes to cut that -999 off the back foot but, seeing the ball rear more than he thought, he leaves that -999 alone in the end",1
7384,8.04E+11,7.5, more good line-and-length action from taylor and the batsman judges to leave that -999,1
7385,8.04E+11,7.4, driven to cover,1
7386,8.04E+11,7.3, left alone outside off,1

7389,8.04E+11,0.6, raps khan high on the thigh with -999 which arcs at and -999 from the batsman who manages to defend it down,10
7390,8.04E+11,0.5, huge roars from the crowd as they think khan's edged that -999 through to the keeper - nearly but not quite. dramatic stuff here,10
7391,8.04E+11,0.4," more runs - a -999 this time - as khan manages the ball well. it got a little big on him, but he gave himself enough room to step into that cut shot and it's nearly cut off by the rope...but not quite and khan's in the runs",10
7392,8.04E+11,0.3, gone! nazir was trying to drive through the off side and the thinnest of edges is enough to remove him - an easy catch for ramdin behind the sticks. it's all going on in the first over,10
7393,8.04E+11,0.2," wide again and nazir takes an easy step back and pings that right over backward point for a flat -999, lovely stuff and a great way to get off the mark",10
7394,8.04E+11,0.1, wide down the off channel and that's easily left alone first up,10
7395,8.04E+11,45.6," on the off and middle stump line, pushed to cover point",2
7396,8.04E+11,45.5," on the off and middle stump line, pulled to deep midwicket",2

7399,8.04E+11,45.2," he is gone!  he attempts another slap-slog, across the line, makes no contact and his offstump is pegged back.",2
7400,8.04E+11,45.1," almost at the blockhole, on the middle and off, ponting can only push it back to the bowler",2
7401,8.04E+11,43.5, now hussey gets it down to long on,4
7402,8.04E+11,43.4, ricky ponting ... take a bow! 23rd odi ton and his fourth wc hundred. reaches it with a drive to long-on.,4

7411,8.04E+11,27.6," quicker on off this time. with twinkling feet, clarke moves -999 and cuts wide of the gully fielder for a fine -999",5
7412,8.04E+11,27.5," quicker again, defended off the back foot. clarke appears in the mood here",5
7413,8.04E+11,27.4, quicker through the air this time. defended watchfully,5
7414,8.04E+11,27.3, clarke down the track and patted back to the bowler,5
7415,8.04E+11,27.2, bit of hesitation after ponting drives to the off side but a mis-field allows the batsmen to complete a -999,5
7416,8.04E+11,27.1, rogers slow through the air. bit of bounce after pitching. ponting goes back and drives it uppishly to the point fielder,5
7417,8.04E+11,9.6," on the middle stump line, gilchrist turns it to left of mid-on who fires in a throw. rebounds off the batsmen's bat and runs -999 to the boundary. -999 extra runs. such is life, such is this game.",8
7418,8.04E+11,9.5, sliding -999 from gilchrist who shapes to cut but the length is not that short and it runs down towards short thirdman region,8
7419,8.04E+11,9.4," goes back to a back of length delivery, pushes it -999 to cover region",8
7420,8.04E+11,9.3," gentle seam-up stuff, outside off, hayden opens the bat-face, runs it past point for a easy -999.",8
7421,8.04E+11,9.2, short and gilchrist immediately pushes back to pull it to deep midwicket,8
7422,8.04E+11,9.1," full and outside off, left alone. the wicketkeeper smith is standing up",8
7423,8.04E+11,7.6," similar delivery and straighter. patted back down the ground. australia not doing anything reckless here, just going after the loose deliveries and that seems to be enough",6
7424,8.04E+11,7.5, blain back to probing outside off. that's something he has been doing really well. gilchrist shoulders arms and has nothing to do with it,6
7425,8.04E+11,7.4," full and on the pads, drilled easily to midwicket for a couple",6
7426,8.04E+11,7.3, short ball from blain and gilchrist is up for the challenge. pulls with a mighty swing and a thick top edge files over short fine-leg for a -999-bounce -999.,6
7427,8.04E+11,7.2, straight and accurate from blain. gilchrist gives it the respect it deserves and defends it back to the bowler,6
7428,8.04E+11,7.1, wide and slightly back of a length. gilchrist goes for the fierce slash but can't time it. straight to the cover fielder,6
7429,8.04E+11,6.6, too wide from hoffmann. the first real rank delivery and hayden punishes it with a slash through covers. ball races -999 to the point fence,11
7430,8.04E+11,6.5, defended off the back foot,11
7431,8.04E+11,6.4," quite a bit of swing into the batsman. no room for hayden, as he tries to -999 the stroke. cramped for room and brings his bat down in the last moment. appeal for lbw but that was going down leg",11
7432,8.04E+11,6.3, blitzer! hayden walks down the -999 nonchalantly and dismisses the ball over the long-on fence for a cracking -999. hayden at his bullying best there.,11
7433,8.04E+11,6.2," back of a length delivery and luckily it was straight. hayden, standing outside his crease,  was lining up an almighty swing. checked his shot in the last minute",11
7434,8.04E+11,6.1, tip and run from gilchrist. tapped to cover and gilchrist steals an easy -999. short cover comes into place for hayden,11
7435,8.04E+11,5.6, shade of inswing from blain. hayden defends it back to the bowler,12
7436,8.04E+11,5.5, good seam movement again. pitched on leg and moving -999 from the left hander. hayden gets -999 with a thickish edge that squirts past gully for a brace,12
7437,8.04E+11,5.4, short ball from blain. not that quick though and gilchrist rocks back and turns it square on the leg side for an easy -999,12
7438,8.04E+11,5.3, straight and back of a length this time. gilchrist on the back foot and defends it confidently.,12
7439,8.04E+11,5.2, ouch! too close to the body and gilchrist gets -999 with a wild slash. thick edge flies over first slip for another boundary. moral victory for blain - if ever there's anything like a moral victory,12
7440,8.04E+11,5.1, typical gilchrist response. blain pushes it too full and gilchrist smashes it through the extra cover region. surely it must have burnt some grass on the way to the fence,12
7441,8.04E+11,5.1, oh! no ball called but quite a handful for gilchrist. teasing outside off and moving it -999 off the seam. gilchrist beaten comprehensively that time,12
7442,8.04E+11,33.6," well tossed up outside off, batsmen in a quandry about whether to attack or defend and chooses the safer option in the last moment. silly point waiting for the edge but it drops short",1

7580,8.05E+12,9.2," valiant attempt by pollard but it evades him into the long-on boundary. rahane comes down the track and chips this -999 in the air. it seems as though it might be a straightforward catch for long-on, but so good was the timing on that -999 that it beats pollard who puts in a full-blooded leap and still cannot get to it. just sublime timing",11

7913,8.05E+12,14.4," full, on the stumps, backs -999 and drills it off the inside part of the bat to the bowler",1
7914,8.05E+12,14.3," full, angling in, looks for a big slog over cow corner and gets an inside edge towards midwicket",1
7915,8.05E+12,14.2," good length, fired from wide of the crease and angling in on middle, knocks it from the front of the pads between midwicket and mid-on",1
7916,8.05E+12,14.1," short of a length, outside off, opens the face of his bat and taps it to point. no run there",1
7917,8.05E+12,18.6, excellent delivery. sees the batsman backing -999 and follows him. fires it full and the ball goes from between the bat and pad and to the keeper,7

7921,8.05E+12,18.2," what an effort from sanju samson! my god, that is the best bit of fielding -999 have seen this ipl, trumps stokes's effort in the previos game. moves to his right, jumps up, catches it mid-air over his head. flicks it back as he dives full-length over the boundary. coming to the delivery, it was full, outside off and pandey shovels it over long-on",7
7922,8.05E+12,18.1," full, angling in, pushed -999 wide of long-on. they push for -999 but end up settling for -999",7
7923,8.05E+12,12.6," full and on the pads, clipped off them uppishly in the direction of deep midwicket, lands on the bounce in front of billings who is guarding the boundary there",11
7924,8.05E+12,12.5, sees him come down the track and the bowler fires it on the pad. the ball misses the flicks and goes off the pad to midwicket. they come charging back for the second. no direct hit at the non-striker's end and even a direct hit may still not have been good enough. good running,11
7925,8.05E+12,12.4," slower short ball, just 106 kph, tries to pull but gets the timing all wrong. this time pant was not standing up to the stumps and the ball drops into the surface after it takes the glove of pathan",11

7927,8.05E+12,12.2, moves -999 outside leg stump early to give himself the room to free his arms. the bowler tries to follow him by angling it in but pandey still finds the room he was looking for. whip[s it uppishly off the pads and uses his wrists well to cart it over deep midwicket,11

7929,8.05E+12,9.6," was that deliberate? seems like. short of good length but not much room on offer. pandey hangs back and opens the face of his half-angled bat very late, gets an outside edge that goes past pant diving full-length to his right and -999 to the third man boundary she goes",13
7930,8.05E+12,9.5," full, outside off, knocks it hard back towards the bowler",13
7931,8.05E+12,9.5," misses the batsman's pad as well as the keeper diving to his left. sliding on leg and pandey tries to glance it -999, gets the pad outside the line of the ball and it sneaks -999 just outside leg. keeper fails to stop it as well",13
7932,8.05E+12,9.4," back of a length, outside off, cut -999 to the left of sweeper for a -999",13
7933,8.05E+12,9.3," short and wide outside off, punched -999 square of the -999 for a -999",13
7934,8.05E+12,9.2," short of a length, at 123 kph, pathan is through with the pull a tad early and the ball does not bounce as much as he would have liked. gets it -999 off the bottom part of the bat",13
7935,8.05E+12,9.1," short of a length, angling in to the body, gets cramped for room as he looks to punch and gets an inside edge to backward square leg",13
7936,8.05E+12,8.6, what kind of a shot is that! that -999's just brute force. mishra drops it short again and there is room on offer outside off. pathan opens up his arms and just flat-bats it. shovels it straight down the ground,14
7937,8.05E+12,8.5, gets down for a slog sweep and gets an inside edge to the pad,14
7938,8.05E+12,8.4," short and wide, cut off the backfoot to sweeper cover",14
7939,8.05E+12,8.4, tries to take it -999 from the batsman but fires it too wide outside off,14
7940,8.05E+12,8.3, good use of the feet. comes down the track and meets the pitch of the ball. makes sure to give himself enough room before thumping it in the direction of the sigtscreen,14
7941,8.05E+12,8.2," tossed up wide outside off, mistimes the drive to long-off",14
7942,8.05E+12,8.1," short and spinning -999, slapped hard off the backfoot to the right of sweeper cover",14
7943,8.05E+12,10.6," full at off stump, front leg -999 of the way as he pummels this drive uppishly towards the bowler. it's hit too hard for the bowler to get down. he ends up stopping it with his boot, unintentionally",12

7945,8.05E+12,10.4," good length at leg stump, pushed with soft hands towards deep midwicket. maxwell runs in hard and releases quickly. ojha is panicking at the non-strikers end as he dives. the throw is wide though and he's safe",12
7946,8.05E+12,10.3, changes his action. this is low-arm and slingy. but he drops it nice and short outside leg stump for warner to swivel and find the long leg boundary,12
7947,8.05E+12,10.2," back of a length at off stump, backs -999 and chops it to point",12
7948,8.05E+12,10.1," mohit loses his footing as he goes for the catch. this is a carrom ball, good length at middle stump. ojha top-edges a sweep that hangs up to he right and in front of mohit at deep square. he seems to get there but falls over and that's -999 in the end as he sticks -999 a hand to protect himself",12
7949,8.05E+12,8.6," reverse-ramp for a -999. this is flat, good length at middle stump and cariappa generally is quicker through the air and off the pitch. perfect for a release shot on this pitch. warner switches his stance quickly and lifts it with the angle over the third man boundary",8
7950,8.05E+12,8.5," good length at middle stump, opens his stance and chops it late, finds backward point",8
7951,8.05E+12,8.4," short and wide outside off stump, hangs back, waits for it, and chips it to sweeper cover",8

7961,8.05E+12,19.4," kaul has shattered the off stump! after all the length balls and the wides, kaul has found the yorker. ishant looks to slice this past point but that is too good for him. kaul has his arms outstretched as he runs wild through the off side. he's tackled by yuvraj singh. it's been an all-punjab star cast for this final phase of the game...just not the ipl franchise.",5
7962,8.05E+12,19.3," oh god. low full toss at off stump, he's tapped it straight back to the bowler with a high elbow",5
7963,8.05E+12,19.3," no, no, no, no. not there. he looks nervous. bowls it full and wide down the leg side",5
7964,8.05E+12,19.2," back of  a length outside off stump, stands tall and punches this classily to sweeper cover",5
7965,8.05E+12,19.2," slower ball, outside off stump. was that wide? looked like it has just come back in from the marker, but it's given. he was looking to hit this over the midwicket boundary",5
7966,8.05E+12,19.1, oh what a shot! these punjab team-mates will have a lot to talk about after this! he's across the off stump and waiting on -999 knee. kaul bowls a length ball and sandeep has managed to lift it over sran at short fine. he gives chase and nearly fumbles in his eagerness to hold on,5
7967,8.05E+12,16.6," back of a length outside off stump, beaten again as he wafts across the line",7
7968,8.05E+12,16.5," back of a length outside off stump, fends at it -999 from the body and is beaten. there's a loud appeal and the umpire turns it down",7
7969,8.05E+12,16.4," dropped! should we switch to bold text for the rest of the night? this is back of a length outside off stump. vohra has played a classy back foot punch, right off the middle but it is flat and straight at dhawan who has lost it in his mid-riff after taking the catch. put it down as he lost balance. warner's celebration was short-lived.",7
7970,8.05E+12,16.3," vohra keeps going. low full toss outside off stump, completely focused as he waits for this and slices it past point with an open face. dhawan can't get across this time",7
7971,8.05E+12,16.2," another twist. slower ball at a length outside off stump, mohit attempts that slice again. this time the pitch is true to its character. he can't hit it off that length and that pace over the off side. finds dhawan at sweeper. was that a smart option?",7
7972,8.05E+12,16.1," low full toss at leg stump, thick inside edge to deep midwicket as he looks to drive this",7
7973,8.05E+12,13.6," nabi almost pulls off a stunner. this is short and in the corridor. it's sliding through and he looks to ramp this over short third man. it flies to nabi's left. there's some pace on it though so he reaches -999 with his right hand, similar to when colingwood caught hayden all those years ago. but he can't hold on. dropped. parries it and gives chase in the end",4
7974,8.05E+12,13.5," full ball at middle stump, walks across and gets rapped on the pad, but there was a big inside edge first",4
7975,8.05E+12,13.4," good length, very wide outside off stump. no way he's getting to that without moving his feet. that's the course he chooses. slashes well -999 from his body and slices it generously to sweeper cover",4

7984,8.05E+12,8.1, nabi has the last laugh. it's a similar line and length to the first -999 he bowled today. but this is slightly quicker and it skids through. keeps low. morgan is also not as positive as he was at the start of the fifth over. dot balls do that. he's late on bringing his bat down at this and middle stump takes a knocking,4
7985,8.05E+12,5.6," and another. this is a googly outside off stump, it's overpitched, and he drives this uppishly, wide of mid-off",19
7986,8.05E+12,5.5," clattered. what a sound. the perfect connection. this was fired flat, a googly, at middle stump. that was clarity of the mind for him to go down immediately and through with the slog sweep. cleanly slotted into the stands over the midwicket boundary",19

7991,8.05E+12,5.1," fires a slider down the leg side, good length. it clips the pads and runs -999 fine. sran gives chase and does really well, despite digging his knee into the turf, to pull it back",19

7993,8.05E+12,4.5," good length, fired flat at middle stump, whipped off the back foot to backward square leg",10

7997,8.05E+12,4.1," -999 first ball. this is a top quality shot. back of a length, skids in at off stump. it wasn't too short but  morgan was back quickly and lifted this, almost with a straight bat, over mid-on and that boundary too",10
7998,8.05E+12,14.6, oh this sounds so good! picks the wrong'un that's angled in at off stump. it's the perfect sweeping length and he brings -999 the perfect sweep to launch it over deep midwicket,18
7999,8.05E+12,14.5," wrong'un, short and wide outside off stump, mistimed cut to deep extra",18
8000,8.05E+12,14.4," nice. full at off stump. this -999 is closer to him than the first ball of the over, so he can control it better. hence can lift it where he wants. he choose wide of long-on again and hoicks it sweetly",18
8001,8.05E+12,14.3," back of a length outside off, chopped off the back foot to sweeper cover",18
8002,8.05E+12,14.2," wrong'un, short and wide outside off stump, reaches -999 and just about gets bat on the cut. finds deep extra cover",18
8003,8.05E+12,14.2," wrong'un, to short, too wide, kohli doesn't want to be near that. lets it go",18

8208,8.05E+12,18.6," yorker on off stump, saha digs it -999 to cover and pinches a -999",18
8209,8.05E+12,18.5," full and wide outside off, carves it to deep cover",18
8210,8.05E+12,18.4," good running catch by finch at long-on. axar fancies taking on a short ball, just outside off stump, and he could well have got himself a boundary if not for the long-on fielder's calmness under pressure. moves to his left quickly, sticks -999 both hands just far enough and makes a touch grab look easy",18
8211,8.05E+12,18.3," moves around the -999, goes slower ball again, but axar is waiting for these. he is not being deceived by these. he's in fact loving the change to get under the ball. launches a massive -999 over long-on, into the second tier",18
8212,8.05E+12,18.2," another slower ball outside off, this -999 at top pace, and even that goes against smith because axar swings, gets an outside edge and it flies past the right of short third man",18
8213,8.05E+12,18.1, you can't give the part-timer such pressure overs but lions had little choice. the offcutter is pitched on a length on leg stump and axar gets under it to lift it over deep midwicket,18
8214,8.05E+12,14.6," round-arms a flat delivery into middle, axar pushes it to long-on.",7
8215,8.05E+12,14.5," good length ball on off stump, stoinis goes back and pushes it down to long-on",7
8216,8.05E+12,14.4," drives through cover, off the back foot",7
8217,8.05E+12,14.3," pushes it through on off stump, axar blocks",7
8218,8.05E+12,14.2," looks for the reverse sweep, but though the length is there for it, to get under the ball and power it -999, the pace is too quick. struck on the front thigh, but he is bending down to hit the shot and is in line with middle stump.",7
8219,8.05E+12,14.1," excellent batting. he sees fine leg up, plants his front foot across, outside off, and lap sweeps a flatter delivery, using all its pace to his advantage",7
8220,8.05E+12,11.6," offcutter, easily picked, but since it lands in the blockhole, amla can only dig it -999",13
8221,8.05E+12,11.5," goes full and outside off, maxi, leaning back, drags it -999 to midwicket",13
8222,8.05E+12,11.4," loopy slower ball, which amla reads just in time. he had set up for the sweep, delays his shot just enough to pinch a -999 to short fine leg",13
8223,8.05E+12,11.3," fullish on off stump, amla dialls up the drive, but even he wouldn't have predicted he would get -999. mostly because mccullum is the fielder there, but this time he falls well below his usual standards. lets the ball through his legs, not bending low enough",13
8224,8.05E+12,11.2," full and curling into leg stump, maxwell stands still, brings his powerful bottom hand into play and slugs it to long-on",13
8225,8.05E+12,11.1," no, no, no, you can't allow maxwell to get under the ball. he picks th e short delivery so early, rocks back, swivels on the back foot and launches it over midwicket",13
8226,8.05E+12,1.6," dabs it to point and since it is just enough to the right of the fielder, they take him on. jadeja gets in a direct hit at the keeper's end, but amla is well in",5
8227,8.05E+12,1.5," that's more like it. brings -999 the straight bat, puts in all his power. the only reason this isn't a -999 to long-on is because nathu got down to it in time and deflected it to mid-on",5
8228,8.05E+12,1.4," lovely timing, off a mis-hit. marsh is drawn into playing -999 from his body by a wide half-volley. and yet it beats the -999 points running after it and even the deep third man running to his left.",5
8229,8.05E+12,1.3," full and wide outside off, marsh flashes and misses",5
8230,8.05E+12,1.2," great bowling, and what a super catch from karthik behind the stumps. this is a test match length, which does not allow vohra the clarity about what he needs to do with his feet. should -999 go forward, or back? and by the time he can decide, the ball is on him, having seamed -999 off the pitch. vohra has to play, and for that trouble, he gets an outside edge that is excellently pouched by karthik diving to his right",5
8231,8.05E+12,1.1," there for the drive and vohra times it superbly. lovely high elbow, good stride forward, the only thing missing is the placement. hits straight to cover",5
8232,8.05E+12,0.6," the variation goes wrong. wants to finish the over without too much damage, so he goes for the flatter, quicker delivery. only thing is it's short and wide. amla picks the length so early, rocks back and cuts it past point",11
8233,8.05E+12,0.5," good work, as he stops a -999 by diving to his right in his followthrough. happy to keep flighting the ball, agarwal.",11
8234,8.05E+12,0.4," flighted delivery on off stump, eased to long-off",11
8235,8.05E+12,0.3," immediately the next ball is flatter and quicker, amla taps it to long-off",11
8236,8.05E+12,0.2," offers a touch of width and that's more than enough for -999 of the best batsmen in the world. amla holds his shape, gets to the pitch of the half-volley and caresses it past the left of the cover fielder",11
8237,8.05E+12,0.1," starts with a loopy, low full toss, which vohra drives to long-off",11
8238,8.05E+12,18.6," full and fast outside off stump, umesh was heaving leg side at middle stump to it as it flew past the outside edge",5
8239,8.05E+12,18.5," slower ball, full at off stump. slides under the attempted slog, then bounces over the stumps because of the loop",5
8240,8.05E+12,18.4," slower bouncer at middle stump, hangs back and somehow fends it past short fine leg, it rolls to the long leg region",5
8241,8.05E+12,18.3," slower ball, dips outside off stump at a length and cuts -999 sharply to beat the outside edge",5
8242,8.05E+12,18.2," good length, angled in at off stump, pushed into the leg side with the wrists again",5
8243,8.05E+12,18.1," good length at off stump, gets behind the line and taps it to deep midwicket off the front foot",5
8244,8.05E+12,15.6," low full toss on the pads, flicked into the gap between deep square and deep midwicket",9
8245,8.05E+12,15.5," length ball but another cutter, not much pace to run it down but surya tries to do just that and misses. this gripped the surface and spun -999",9
8246,8.05E+12,15.4," short of length outside off, thumped to sweeper cover",9
8247,8.05E+12,15.3," yorker on middle, squeezed to long-on",9
8248,8.05E+12,15.2," swept into the square leg fence. aravind sees him moving inside the crease and drops this short, perhaps in an attempt to bounce him, but surya nails the sweep into the gap. chahal at the boundary had no chance",9
8249,8.05E+12,15.1," floats a cutter outside off, woakes mistimes an attempted lofted hit to long-off",9
8250,8.05E+12,5.6," angles -999 in full on off from wide of the crease, defended back down the pitch",9
8251,8.05E+12,5.5, drives the length ball on the up to cover,9
8252,8.05E+12,5.4," timed beautifully but he's picked -999 the lone man at deep square leg. too short, he goes back into the crease and whips that -999. chahal was right there at the ropes and took it with both hands facing the sky. narine's done his job though, he's livid with himself for playing that shot",9
8253,8.05E+12,5.3," floats this full outside off from wide of the crease, narine uses his stretch to reach -999 and slice this over short third man. not sure it was deliberate, looked like he was trying to hit over point but he'll take the runs anyway",9
8254,8.05E+12,5.2," steps -999 and flat-bats -999 to mid-off, gave him the charge and gave -999 his intention very early. was cramped for room so couldn't complete the shot",9

8258,8.05E+12,8.4, looks to slash this over point but is beaten because of the bounce,5
8259,8.05E+12,8.3," gets this to angle back in full on the stumps from wide of the crease, badree plays down the wrong line. the ball misses the inside edge to hit him on the pad. would've smashed the middle of middle.",5

8263,8.05E+12,2.5, punched on the up to mid-off,15
8264,8.05E+12,2.4," edged and over third man. too full, he backed -999 to carve this behind point but just about managed to squeeze this over surya at wide second slip. useful boundary",15
8265,8.05E+12,2.4, slants a wide down leg. slower ball gone wrong. jadhav was early into the pull. the free-hit will stay,15
8266,8.05E+12,2.4," gets this to jag -999 off the seam from length outside off, jadhav lets it go. this -999's another no-ball.  free-hit for jadhav ",15
8267,8.05E+12,2.3," oh, dear. what is happening at eden? ab tries to fetch a pull from outside off and the extra pace of coulter-nile doe the trick as ab top-edges the pull to uthappa behind the stumps. the bottom hand came off the glove as he completed the pull, the ball was swirling for a long time, uthappa called for it and pouched it cleanly on the dive.  that delivery was a shade under 150 clicks ",15
8268,8.05E+12,2.2, gift of a delivery for ab. full and drifting into the pads and he tickles it into the fine leg boundary,15
8269,8.05E+12,2.1," leading edge that flies past where third slip would've been, down to third man. looked to flick but this -999 held its line",15

8274,8.05E+12,16.2, drops short of mid-off. this is full outside off stump from around the -999. his feet have not moved an inch as he plays the cover drive. gets it off the toe. it floats teasingly in front of mid-off who dives to his left but can't get his body behind it,11
8275,8.05E+12,16.1," got him. this isn't a particularly good ball. in the slot outside leg stump, and in his arc too. but stokes hasn't put a stride in and has to end up reaching -999 for it. can't do it successfully, and it hits leg stump",11

8284,8.05E+12,11.4," dropped! a complete mess of a complete dolly. this is full at leg stump, he can't get on top of this sweep. gets the leading edge and it flies flat, straight to bhajji at deep square leg who messes it up to his left at waist height",12
8285,8.05E+12,11.3," tossed up outside off, steps -999 and doesn't get to the pitch. his front foot tends to go across and not forward, and that might be why he was marginally short of the pitch. looks to go inside--999 but it was turning -999 and he got it off the bottom outer half of the bat. skewed wide of long-off where pollard ran comfortably to his left to get under it",12

8291,8.05E+12,4.3," back of a length outside off stump, it's angling in at him and he can't get it right off the centre, but he has timed it well enough to punch this past extra cover",6
8292,8.05E+12,4.2," back of a length, angled into the body. he looks to swivel and pull this fine, but it thuds him hard on the thigh guard and runs to short fine's left",6

8303,8.05E+12,2.3, angles it in at off stump at a good length. rahane puts in the perfect forward stride and merely pushes this past the bowler and wide mid-off,7
8304,8.05E+12,2.2," short at middle stump, gets stuck halfway into his pull shot as he is hurried by pace, in the end he can only shovel it into the leg side",7

8661,8.05E+12,1.5," length ball, looks like the offcutter coming in towards off stump. samson plants his front foot down the pitch, ends up a little cramped for room, and is forced to defend",13
8662,8.05E+12,1.4," back of a length, this time he follows nair's movement -999 from leg stump. dabs it down towards point",13
8663,8.05E+12,1.3," back of a length close to off stump, and nair makes himself plenty of room, exposes all -999 stumps, and simply lifts the ball over the covers. not much pace at all, and nair had plenty of time to steady himself and time that shot",13

8665,8.05E+12,1.1, back of a length on off stump and samson just swats that -999. takes half a step forward and launches this up and over wide long-on,13
8666,8.05E+12,0.6," back of a length, a bit of nip back in off the track to cramp nair for room. tries to force it through the off side and the ball beats his inside edge and hits him in the hip area",3
8667,8.05E+12,0.5," onto the pads now and bhuvneshwar has square leg back, tucked -999 to that fielder for a quiet -999",3
8668,8.05E+12,0.4," this -999 isn't quite as full, and samson has some width again. the shorter length allows him to slice this deliberately over backward point, and siddarth kaul, chasing to his right from third man, puts in -999 dives to stop the ball in -999 installments",3
8669,8.05E+12,0.3," fullish and fairly wide outside off, flat-batted to cover point",3
8670,8.05E+12,0.2," another outswinger on a good length, a bit closer to off stump, comes forward and eases with an open bat-face to backward point",3

8672,8.05E+12,19.6, loopy slower full-toss wider outside off - wider than a set of stumps - reaches -999 and toe-ends it to short third man,4
8673,8.05E+12,19.5," just short of a good length and outside off, chopped -999. tahir dives to his right at short third man and takes some pace off the ball",4
8674,8.05E+12,19.4, picked off the pads to deep square leg,4
8675,8.05E+12,19.3, the batsman steps -999 outside leg and looks to whip it over midwicket. this is the slower ball chasing him. sppons a leading edge to backward point,4
8676,8.05E+12,19.2," slower ball outside off, swings and misses",4
8677,8.05E+12,19.1," near yorker on off, dug -999 to leg",4
8678,8.05E+12,18.6," full and angled across off, he can't connect with his leg-side slog",21
8679,8.05E+12,18.5," nasty collision between smith and stokes near the edge of the boundary. smith rams into stokes and tumbles over the boundary. his head bangs against an ad board. he seems okay. he gives the thumbs-up. this was the slower ball on off stump, coulter-nile swings it across the line. gets plenty of height. smith runs to his right from long-on, stokes to his left from deep midwicket. stokes takes the catch but goes over the ad board and collides with smith. it could have been uglier",21
8680,8.05E+12,18.4," seam-up, very full and angling -999 wide outside off, driven through the covers",21
8681,8.05E+12,18.3," third straight slower ball. third straight boundary. this -999 goes all the way. offcutter ends on middle, goes low, and scoops it all the way over fine leg",21

8684,8.05E+12,17.6," clatters into the -999 of the helmet. nasty, nastly blow. banged in short, 142ks, deceptive pace. coulter-nile is late onto the hook. he is rushed for pace. the ball thuds into the helmet and drops onto the ground. christian immediately shows concern for coulter-nile. smith walks up and checks on his australian team-mate as well. this results in a hold-up in play",9
8685,8.05E+12,17.5," short on off, backs -999 outside leg and scythes it to sweeper",9
8686,8.05E+12,17.4," -999, back of a length on middle, punched wide of long-on. surya and woakes chance the second. the throw is the deep is flat, christian collects it and takes the bails off. woakes has been caught well short",9

8693,8.05E+12,6.3," back of a length and angled in on middle and leg, worked -999 to deep square leg",3
8694,8.05E+12,6.2," back of a length and outside off, opens the face and runs it to point",3

8702,8.05E+12,18.6," is that a wide? no, the umpire says it hit the thigh pad. a good length ball on leg stump gets a flick in answer, but sundar misses making connection with bat. he is however alert to an overthrow",3
8703,8.05E+12,18.5," low full toss on off stump, nudges to short midwicket. the crowd goes up, thinking this is a catch.",3
8704,8.05E+12,18.4," he's gone! gone for 93. gone to a slower ball. is there life in this game yet? poor tripathi. he has timed better balls to the boundary. this -999 is short, it has ample room to free the arms, he does free his arms, but pulls it straight to midwicket. rovman powell, who is yet to get a game, takes the catch",3
8705,8.05E+12,18.3," bouncer - tripathi loads up a hook, but it climbs up beyond his reach. the umpire lets it pass",3

8707,8.05E+12,18.1, races down the pitch to carve a shortish delivery through to deep cover,3
8708,8.05E+12,11.6," tosses it up on off stump, drives to long-off",9
8709,8.05E+12,11.5, covers all his stumps and then flicks a good length ball through to deep square leg. well taken -999. stokes made sure to use only a limited amount of his power in that shot,9
8710,8.05E+12,11.4, looks for another slog sweep - he is playing that shot the moment a ball is tossed up outside off. this time though he inside edges to deep midwicket,9
8711,8.05E+12,11.3," appeal for a stumping as tripathi looks to block but he misses. clearly he hasn't read the ball turning -999 from the right-hander. jackson, the keeper, has not. takes it cleanly and then knocks the bails off. the batsman, however, listens to his instincts after he is beaten and drags his back foot back in time",9
8712,8.05E+12,11.2," that's a bad effort from woakes, and he knows it, screams at himself. at deep midwicket, he moves to his left, but is way too slow to get down. a slog sweep meant to be -999 becomes -999",9
8713,8.05E+12,11.1, goes back to hit a good length ball spinning -999 from him through cover,9
8714,8.05E+12,3.6," now he picks the slower ball. this is a legcutter, telegraphed to the batsman, so wide and with little love-notes. tripathi accepts with a slash over point",17
8715,8.05E+12,3.5," sails -999. pace on the ball is working to tripathi's plans. he swivels on the back foot, reaches up to the ball, which is over his head on off stump, and hooks it - right off the middle - over the fine leg boundary",17
8716,8.05E+12,3.4," opens the face and taps a shortish delivery towards point. smith steps down looking for a -999, waits for the fielder to misfield, and then gets through",17
8717,8.05E+12,3.3," fine leg is up inside the circle, so he shuffles across, trying to lift a back of a length delivery on off stump over yusuf pathan. no such luck",17
8718,8.05E+12,3.2, whips a full delivery tailing into him through midwicket,17
8719,8.05E+12,3.1," and they just keep coming. smith deciding he has to match tripathi, comes down the track, gives it a flat-batted slap, gets an inside edge past the keeper diving to his left",17
8720,8.05E+12,1.6, crunches a shortish delivery - at 140 kph - to point,4
8721,8.05E+12,1.5," and just to confirm that it is him, he shuffles across and tries to take a shortish delivery on off stump and whip it through midwicket. gets only an inside edge",4
8722,8.05E+12,1.4," what a delivery! it just kept closing in on rahane, who thinks he has the chance to run it to third man, a stroke he is impeccably good at. but umesh's pace - and his bounce - the ball just kept rising - takes the glove through to the keeper",4
8723,8.05E+12,1.3," lovely hit - almost carries to the point boundary. and yet the batsman puts in the slightest effort. just swayed his torso back and punched at the ball with an open face, intending to lift it over the infield",4
8724,8.05E+12,1.2," there's deviation - that's why they appeal for caught behind - as rahane hangs back, beside the ball, and looks to dab it down to third man. but the ball has simply swung posthumously",4
8725,8.05E+12,1.1," 139kph, thunders in and bowls shortish on off stump, rahane hops back in his crease to run it to point",4
8726,8.05E+12,9.6, stands up tall and drills a shortish delivery outside of to long-off,10
8727,8.05E+12,9.5," turns it through to deep midwicket, from where samson races in, picks up the ball and sends it through very quickly, not even worrying about maintaining his balance while he releases because he wants to stop them taking a second. unable to do so, but good effort",10
8728,8.05E+12,9.4, lovely placement as he leans over the tossed up delivery on middle and nudges it through midwicket. -999 men in the deep race up towards the ball and make raina think -999,10
8729,8.05E+12,9.3," loops it up on off stump, he drives to long-on",10
8730,8.05E+12,9.2," flatter delivery outside off, karthik pulls to long-on",10
8731,8.05E+12,9.1," quicker delivery off the front of the hand - but since it is short and wide - karthik has everything he needs to cut the ball. then he gets a bonus - the fielder, samson, misfields on the boundary",10
8732,8.05E+12,6.6, drums a full delivery on off stump past the bowler's left to long-on,6
8733,8.05E+12,6.5, swivels on his back foot as he pulls a short ball on middle to long leg,6
8734,8.05E+12,6.4," reads the slower ball better, and having made room on the leg side, guides it through cover for the fifty partnership.",6
8735,8.05E+12,6.3," dropped by midwicket. a seriously well hit ball comes right at him, over his head, and samuels can't hold on. the force is such that it just thuds into his hands before he is ready and even propels him back on his backside",6
8736,8.05E+12,6.2, clears his front leg to try and hoist a back of a length ball over midwicket. a good old agricultural heave. the ball thuds into the back leg of raina,6
8737,8.05E+12,6.1," charges -999 of his crease, and gets a ball that is ripe for the off drive. this time, though, karthik mistimes the shot and has to settle for a -999",6
8738,8.05E+12,2.6, targets the stumps - and the inswing is no help to the batsman - karthik tries to punch down the ground and instead gets an inside edge past short fine leg's left,7
8739,8.05E+12,2.5," beautiful bowling. and at 144 kph, there is precious little time for karthik to react. he sees a good length ball, he knows it is still the powerplay and he has to hit -999. goes for the drive and is comfortably beaten",7
8740,8.05E+12,2.4," back of a length on off stump, defends",7
8741,8.05E+12,2.3, and now the ball lobs up in the region of square leg - from where the fielder was pulled -999 - and raina secures a -999 despite hopping about against cummins' pace,7
8742,8.05E+12,2.2, finally he tries a proper cricket shot and see what happens? takes a shortish delivery on leg stump and flicks it over square leg,7
8743,8.05E+12,2.1," good length ball on off stump, raina tries to smoke it over midwicket, inside edges onto pad",7
8744,8.05E+12,11.6," flat and wide, carved towards point. jakati watches on as the ball passes him, resulting in a couple of expletives being hurled at him by jadeja. -999 more nonetheless",16
8745,8.05E+12,11.5," short down off and middle, pulled to long-on",16
8746,8.05E+12,11.4," an adrenaline rush. flat outside off, flat-batted to long-off. not quite timed. a cruise of a chase this",16
8747,8.05E+12,11.3," flat outside off, tapped towards point",16
8748,8.05E+12,11.2," -999 more. -999 on the bounce. flat and wide outside off, samson gets underneath the length and lofts the ball over cover for another -999. great hitting, he's picking his slots",16
8749,8.05E+12,11.1," -999 more. this is the top tier. what is happening to batting in cricket. full outside off, samson's loft goes 99 metres long, over long-on.",16
8750,8.05E+12,8.6," raina drops short and pant says thanks. sits back, waits and waits and waits and then pulls merrily -999 over midwicket for a huge -999 to get to his fifty. a blitzy knock.",14
8751,8.05E+12,8.5," cut behind point for a couple. short and wide from raina, sliced behind point",14
8752,8.05E+12,8.4," and then mccullum pulls it back. flat and wide, hammered wide of long-on where mccullum puts in a dive to his left to save -999",14
8753,8.05E+12,8.3," a naughty misfield from smith on the sweeper cover boundary. flat and wide outside off, pant nails a powerful punch from the back foot. smith gets across to his left but lets the ball through",14

8758,8.05E+12,6.4," short and wide, carved to deep point for another -999.",10
8759,8.05E+12,6.3," flat outside off, dabbed to short third man for a -999",10
8760,8.05E+12,6.2," the offspinner bowling to the right-hander. flat on off, samson gets underneath the length and swats a heave over midwicket. if it was in his half, we was always going to go",10
8761,8.05E+12,6.1," short and wide from raina, sliced to the sweeper cover",10
8762,8.05E+12,2.6," strays down leg, off the pad towards square leg. a leg bye",10
8763,8.05E+12,2.5," gone this time. a short delivery on leg, karun looks to bail -999 of the stroke but bails -999 late. he then thinks he has enough time to ramp the ball over short third man. all he does it get an edge through to karthik. not a bad stroke with 209 to chase, but execution not too great",10
8764,8.05E+12,2.4," full and straight, flicked wide of mid-on for a run. this is good batting. singles off all other balls means it will be a good over",10
8765,8.05E+12,2.3," good length delivery outside off, carved to deep backward point. interesting position",10
8766,8.05E+12,2.2," changes the line. pushes it fuller and a lot wider outside off, a thick outside edge to third man",10
8767,8.05E+12,2.1," picks the length so early does samson and weeeeee, the ball goes over square leg. all timing. a length delivery on leg, he sees the length early and a swat gives him -999. lovely",10
8768,8.05E+12,15.6, goes across a tad and clips the ball from middle and leg towards square leg for -999 and keeps strike,8
8769,8.05E+12,15.5," loops it up again, it's a highish full toss, punched down to long off",8

8774,8.05E+12,15.1," angling in from outside off, punched off the back foot for -999",8
8775,8.05E+12,2.6, there's an appeal for a run -999 as ab drove that dead straight and it hit the stumps at non-striker's end. sandeep is claiming it touched his fingers and replays show it did. it looks like mandeep's bat was down just in time but the third umpire wants to be 120% sure. not -999 gives the local crowd some relief,1
8776,8.05E+12,2.5," he's got kohli too, clean bowled! kohli charged down quickly, it was an inswinger from sandeep which pitched around off and middle and came in, kohli swung hard and missed it completely. what a blow for rcb, what accurate bowling from sandeep",1
8777,8.05E+12,2.4," stays a bit low outside off, kohli is on the back foot and defends as he watches it carefully",1
8778,8.05E+12,2.3," no movement now, slightly outside off and mandeep chops it to third man",1
8779,8.05E+12,2.2," some -999 movement now, mandeep watches the slightly fuller length, goes for a big swing and it misses the outside edge",1

8781,8.05E+12,1.6," 134kph, bangs it a little short, kohli stays back this time to defend to off again",15
8782,8.05E+12,1.5," takes a step down to show his intent, it's a length delivery outside off without much room and kohli defends it to off",15

8787,8.05E+12,19.6," what a finish from unadkat. a hat-trick maiden in the last over. offcutter outside off, flat-batted to extra cover. there is a mix-up between the wickets, it's eventually a dot. take a bow, unadkat. he becomes only the third player after malinga and badree to take triple--999 maidens in the ipl",0

8790,8.05E+12,19.3, -999 in -999 for unadkat. another slower ball outside off. rashid does not pick it. clears his front leg and toe-ends it in the air. unadkat himself settles under the skier,0
8791,8.05E+12,19.2," unadkat and stokes combine for another -999. slower ball, good length on off, bipul sharma picks it and swings to leg again. he only skews it off the bottom of the bat. gets more height as opposed to distance. holes -999 to stokes(who else?) at deep midwicket",0

10612,8.05E+11,11.3," shortish and outside off, axar rocks back and cuts to deep point. jayant isn't getting much turn, but he still has a slip and is getting -999 with a few bad balls because of kings xi's batting slump",4

10624,8.05E+11,7.4, another great take! de kock throws himself to his right and comes up with a -999-handed save. morris is bowling very briskly tonight and this was a yorker. slides down leg before miller could connect with his flick,7
10625,8.05E+11,7.3, has to leap off his feet to block this 146 kph shortish delivery on middle and leg,7
10626,8.05E+11,7.2," a low full toss on middle and off, morris has his hands on his head. it was the slower ball gone wrong. vohra whips it -999 to long leg",7
10627,8.05E+11,7.1," beaten for pace. this is at 140 kph, and it straightens after pitching as well. vohra doesn't get back and across, so his push with hard hands does not meet anything",7

10668,8.05E+11,8.6," -999, well bowled, jakati! some innate sense must have told him buttler was nervous. that he would come down the track. and so he slips the ball down leg, it's quick as well so the batsman who was trying to adjust with a flick shot can't reach it. dk does an excellent job, moving quickly to his left and whipping the bails off before buttler recovered",9

10694,8.05E+11,16.4, a full toss never helps a bowler and smith shows why! smashes that -999 from just outside off to the wide long-on boundary for the third -999 in -999 balls,15
10695,8.05E+11,16.3," in the block hole outside off, smith steers it to off and marsh dives to his right to save -999",15

10718,8.05E+11,5.5," that's gone through the bowler's legs for -999! it was tossed up well outside off, was pretty full, and faf drives it with a whip with his wrists and straight down the ground for a powerful -999!",11

10723,8.05E+11,4.6," on length around off again, worked to the leg side for -999",11
10724,8.05E+11,4.5," was that premeditated? it surely worked for him - he went across a bit and scooped that length ball from around off and middle, right behind the keeper for -999. that went pretty high too",11
10725,8.05E+11,4.4, pushes the fullish ball down to mid-off for a quick -999,11

10734,8.05E+11,2.1," off the inside edge and onto the stumps! rahane walked across toward the off side a little bit and the ball probably nipped in just a bit, rahane went for an uncharacteristic slog and only got an edge",3

10744,8.05E+11,11.3," back of a length and outside off, pushed into the covers. kohli was haring up for a -999, but watson yells 'wait, wait.'",3
10745,8.05E+11,11.2," he does seem to have that magic touch. it was a length ball, much like many ab has golf-swung over long-on many many times. this time though the bat turns just a bit in his hand and that takes some power off it. just enough for shami to take the catch",3
10746,8.05E+11,11.1," comes down immediately, brathwaite adjusts with a shorter ball. picked -999 to long leg",3
10747,8.05E+11,9.6," googly, pitched on a good length outside off, kohli though has retreated deep into his crease to give him the leverage to pull to deep midwicket",10

10749,8.05E+11,9.4," pushed through quick on leg stump, ab plays a leg glance, doesn't quite connect with bat. it clips the thighs and runs -999. mishra seems afraight to use his greatest strength - his flight -",10
10750,8.05E+11,9.3," shami was running up and to his right from long-on, and he couldn't even collect the ball properly because of the pressure put on by these -999 running. easy -999 after a gently nudge",10
10751,8.05E+11,9.2," width outside off, kohli laces it through to deep cover. the batsman had been shaping to run down. mishy bowled it short and wide. kohli still adjusted",10
10752,8.05E+11,9.1," went on with the arm, ab seems to lower his backlift against spin. or against mishra specifically. picked -999 to long-on",10
10753,8.05E+11,3.6," so why would he go for a short ball at waist high? he's been bowling good pace, veering the ball into the right-hander and cramping him for room. here, he abandons all that, bowls a hit-me ball and gets pulled over deep midwicket",16
10754,8.05E+11,3.5," was that another chance? almost. the inside edge, as kohli plays a flick, was heading towards leg stump, but instead ricocheted off the pad. shami is getting the ball to move into the right-hander quite late",16
10755,8.05E+11,3.4," fuller ball on off stump, defended",16
10756,8.05E+11,3.3," speared -999 to the cover boundary! all along the ground. he preferred to stay just a tad legside of the ball, -999 don't even think he moved his front foot that much, just concentrated on keeping his eyes on the ball and his head still and pierced the gap",16
10757,8.05E+11,3.2," that's dreadful. bowls a delicious short ball way down leg and kohli barely has to do anything more than help it -999. pristine leg glance, intentionally hit over the top",16
10758,8.05E+11,3.1," lbw appeal straight -999! shami still has the zip he gets off the track and its enough to beat ab. pitches just back of a length on off stump and darts into the pads of the batsman. plays a flick, can't connect. too high",16
10759,8.05E+11,18.6," shortish and slow and on off stump, jp shuffles across for a flick through leg. has to settle for a leg bye, which levels the scores!",8
10760,8.05E+11,18.5," low full toss on off stump, jp skews it off the open face past point and gets the couple he wanted",8
10761,8.05E+11,18.4," shortish and outside off, punched through the covers. daredevils doing this easily now",8
10762,8.05E+11,18.3," back of a length on off stump, defended to point",8
10763,8.05E+11,18.2," he wont be there to finish the game. watson does not celebrate. he simply offers applause to a fine innings. goes up to de kock as he walks -999 with a nod of the head. it was slower short ball, dug in and rising towards his shoulder, the batsman swings instinctively. the pull shot only takes the glove and goes to the keeper",8
10764,8.05E+11,18.1, clipped through midwicket,8
10765,8.05E+11,15.6," he was moving outside leg, then he was shaping for the scoop over fine leg, then he reacts to the ball in front of it - a slower short ball outside off - opens the face on it and nearly threads the gap between third man and backward point. leaps in the air as he was watching the ball travel while taking his -999, obviously gutted it didn't go through",12
10766,8.05E+11,15.5," slower ball, full of length, de kock goes for a lace through cover again but gets an inside edge",12
10767,8.05E+11,15.4, that's the kind of shot that tells you which team is winning. a tad overpitched and de kock belts it over the covers. kohli looks crestfallen,12
10768,8.05E+11,15.3," backs -999 leg side, aravind follows with a low full toss, lofted through cover. yuzi misfields and yet its only -999",12
10769,8.05E+11,15.2," nair has played a little beauty! that's the hundred stand. he knew aravind would go full, but didn't premeditate it. went across and down on -999 knee only after the ball was released. it was a full toss, which helped, and he glances it just past the diving keeper",12
10770,8.05E+11,15.1," looks for the fuller -999 just outside off, drilled to long-off",12
10771,8.05E+11,8.6," shortish and outside off, patted to deep third man",14
10772,8.05E+11,8.5," and finally he connects! been playing that upper cut over the keeper for a while, but with harshal's limited pace, he probably gets to see the ball longer, tune his body better and lifts it right over the keeper",14
10773,8.05E+11,8.4, shortish and outside off - rather slow as well - nair shapes to play a late cut and fails to connect,14
10774,8.05E+11,8.3," straying on leg stump, nair flicks it sweetly between long leg and deep square leg but the fielders there are.... you guessed it! watson and wiese. the partnership works again, watson dives to his left running from long leg, wiese collects the relay and its only -999",14
10775,8.05E+11,8.2," back of a length and outside off, pushed down to mid-off. kohli flattens the stump with his throw. de kock thinks about an overthrow. no luck there",14
10776,8.05E+11,8.1, and he's been sent packing! he can play this with his eyes closed. the pick up over square leg. almost jayasuirya-esque. harshal gave him the length to get under and de kock's hands are just too good. guess that's why he's such a good keeper too,14
10777,8.05E+11,4.6," cuts from leg stump, de kock then looked for a -999, but he is sent back. ab ran to his right from point and sends in the throw with not enough venom",8
10778,8.05E+11,4.5," driven past the diving midwicket fielder. aravind was moving to his left, and it would probably have still not stopped the -999",8
10779,8.05E+11,4.4," strides down the track, but when he can't get to the pitch of the offspinner on off stump, samson can only push it back to the bowler",8
10780,8.05E+11,4.3, moves beside the good length ball on off stump and pats it through the gap past cover,8
10781,8.05E+11,4.2," comes down, knowing the bowler would toss it up after his short ball was punished, nudged to midwicket",8
10782,8.05E+11,4.1," he's pitched camp there and will not budge. rcb had backward point and short third man, but de kock threads that gap with a cut. took the ball from off stump",8

10786,8.05E+11,15.3," clever batting, knew the gaps in the field and found -999 brilliantly. yorker outside off, well bowled, but that is not the best delivery with this field. steered past short third man for another -999",7
10787,8.05E+11,15.2," full and wide, just inside the tramline though. pandya shuffles across but cannot connect with his attempted cut",7
10788,8.05E+11,15.1," legcutter on middle to start, pushed to the sweeper cover as rayudu gets fifty. nice rearguard knock this",7
10789,8.05E+11,13.6," -999 more. -999 sixes in the over. mumbai suddenly have all the momentum. full on middle and off, pandya gets down and shaped for another slog sweep but because the ball did not spin, he went through with the lofted straight drive, right over the bowler's head. huge over",26
10790,8.05E+11,13.5," and again, this is even bigger. gets down on -999 leg, and pandya slog-sweeps this way over midwicket. into the stands it goes. this is match-changing batting from pandya. what an over so far",26
10791,8.05E+11,13.4," -999 more. poor bowling, in the slot on middle and leg. pandya swings and connects adequately. over midwicket for -999 more",26
10792,8.05E+11,13.3," flat on middle, swept to short fine leg",26
10793,8.05E+11,13.2," big, huge -999. tossed up on middle, rayudu runs down to the pitch, gets there, gets under it and gets -999. a lovely swing of the bat through the ball, right over the bowler's head",26
10794,8.05E+11,13.1," skied but lands in no-man's land. flat on off, no spin. pandya looks for a mow over midwicket but top-edges it towards mid-off. dhawan runs around from cover but cannot make the distance. falls right in front of his valiant dive",26

10802,8.05E+11,0.5," good length outside off, significant -999 movement. steered to a well-placed gully",2
10803,8.05E+11,0.4," gone. bhuvi has the -999. guptill's ipl debut has not gone to plan. but not much any plan could do for that delivery. fullish length on a fourth-stump line, guptill comes forward and defends, but a hint of -999 movement helps in taking a thin feather through to naman. great start this for sunrisers and bhuvi",2

10813,8.05E+11,9.5, that time his option to cut was a little too ambitious. bhajji slowed it up and tossed it up. should have been forward,10

11048,8.05E+11,9.4, falls safe between the sweeper and the cover running back as karthik plays a swat off the back foot after he is surprised by the bouncer! watson is getting the ball to misbehave like kids when the teacher goes -999.,8

11066,8.05E+11,2.4, another well-executed stroke. morkel takes pace off a fullish delivery outside off but suryakumar executes the late glide to third man,9

11071,8.05E+11,17.5," excellent delivery. in all fairness, this has not been a bad over. another back of the hand slower ball on middle, buttler looks for a heave over midwicket but misses completely. since it is straight, the stumps are clattered. buttler's impressive cameo ends.",11
11072,8.05E+11,17.4," ooh, buttler misses an innovative shot. full and wide outside off, buttler stays where he is, doesn't bother moving his feet and reverse sweeps but misses. dot ball",11
11073,8.05E+11,17.3," and again. not a bad delivery again, the slower delivery -999 of the back of the hand. but buttler shuffles across, shapes for the ramp, waits for the slower ball to come to him before helping it along over the keeper. easy.",11
11074,8.05E+11,17.2," not great captaincy from miller. cannot have fine leg up to this man. fullish outside off, that isn't a bad delivery actually, but buttler has such good hands that all he needs to do is get across to the line. he gets there and uses his hands to scoop the ball over short fine leg",11
11075,8.05E+11,17.1, yorker outside off. parthiv shuffles across and shovels a drive to long-on. not bad to get buttler on strike,11

11100,8.05E+11,3.1," he won't spin too many. full outside off, skids on nicely to the bat. driven to long-off",5
11101,8.05E+11,1.6, oh lovely. the test match trick. a short delivery followed by a full -999 outside off. rayudu's feet are not quite to the pitch. he attempts a drive but the ball swings past the edge,9

11394,8.05E+11,13.3," an appeal for caught behind but it amounts to nothing. this was darted in just outside off, hooda pushes and gets beaten. the sound came from the bat hitting the ground. oh well, has saha missed a stumping chance there? he seemed to have strayed -999 of the crease after his balance was foiled",16

11401,8.05E+11,8.2," whoa! inswinging yorker from mitch, he falls over the flick and takes it on the pad. the ball perhaps was snaking down leg. the pair aim to sneak in a run. miller from the covers swoops in on the ball but fails to throw the stumps down. a direct hit could have landed smith in trouble. bonus run off an overthrow",8
11402,8.05E+11,8.2," wide and -999, that was too hot for saha. mitch bangs a fiery bouncer outside off, it leaps up and flies over the keeper",8

12209,8.04E+11,8.2," on the pads this time, but bray misses -999 and it takes the pad -999 to square leg",0

12223,8.04E+11,3.1," this -999 is wide, morgan goes for the drive and misses...the zimbabweans go up for a catch behind but the umpire signals wide. the bat may have clipped the ground although replays aren't conclusive",3
12224,8.04E+11,2.6," and the over ends in familiar style, a steady maiden but it would help zimbabwe if the batsmen had to play a few more balls",0
12225,8.04E+11,2.5, how long can bray resist having a go at -999 of these deliveries as another -999 passes by? he likes to play to shots,0
12226,8.04E+11,2.4," fourth leave of the over, but the more dot balls sent down the more the pressure will grow. at the moment, though, bray should be happy to see off the new ball",0

12580,8.04E+11,43.2, defended forward,1
12581,8.04E+11,43.1, gone! that's an important -999 for ireland which will puncture the momentum this pair were building - swept up high to the deep backward square leg for what was made to look like an easy catch,1
12582,8.04E+11,38.6, dabbed to mid-on,1
12583,8.04E+11,38.5, worked behind point,1
12584,8.04E+11,38.4," short, and a wayward throw back in from the pull shot as that goes into midwicket - a direct hit at the non-striker's end would have had the batsman a long way -999",1
12585,8.04E+11,38.3," good delivery, forcing the batsman to tilt his head -999 from the shot as it flew past his shoulder, straight, and on to the keeper",1
12586,8.04E+11,38.2," defended forward, a much better shot",1
12587,8.04E+11,38.1," left alone outside off this time, with a gentle bit of swing -999",1
12588,8.04E+11,33.6," plenty of -999 swing, but a touch loose and sami drives -999 to cover, where it's cleanly tidied up",3
12589,8.04E+11,33.5," slower delivery, dies on the pitch, and it's controlled down to third man but morgan does well to dive on to it and return it quickly",3
12590,8.04E+11,33.4," on leg and that's picked off the toes nicely, but straight to the fielder",3
12591,8.04E+11,33.3, a quick -999 down off the back foot into the covers,3
12592,8.04E+11,33.2," pitches on leg and there's another good piece of fielding, with a diving slide from mid-on",3
12593,8.04E+11,33.1," just a touch too straight, but an awkward length and the batsman bends over it in defence",3
12594,8.04E+11,32.6, a straight bat to that -999 which flies off the face into the covers,1
12595,8.04E+11,32.5," straight as a die and that's worked down off the back foot, quietly again",1
12596,8.04E+11,32.4, more quiet defence,1
12597,8.04E+11,32.3, that -999 keeps low and it's defended down,1
12598,8.04E+11,32.2, that rises on its way through to the keeper,1
12599,8.04E+11,32.1, shuffles across his stumps to take that from straight and into the leg side,1

12602,8.04E+11,29.4, lobbed up through fine leg,8
12603,8.04E+11,29.3," delicately played, deliberately uppish through the vacant slip area and that brings up the hundred for pakistan",8
12604,8.04E+11,29.2, comes forward and defends right over that -999,8
12605,8.04E+11,29.1, crashed off the back foot to just inside the off-side sweeper boundary,8
12606,8.04E+11,22.6, played off the back foot to the man on the wide third man boundary,1
12607,8.04E+11,22.5, defended this time,1
12608,8.04E+11,22.4, gets -999 with a low full toss on leg which can only be guided to mid-on,1
12609,8.04E+11,22.3, good line and length again,1
12610,8.04E+11,22.2, unconvincing crash into the foot this time,1
12611,8.04E+11,22.1, left alone outside off,1
12612,8.04E+11,14.6, right on the money and that's defended forward strongly,2
12613,8.04E+11,14.5, wide and driven through extra-cover to get off the mark,2
12614,8.04E+11,14.4, pitched right up there and driven to mid-off,2

12617,8.04E+11,14.1, defended well on the front foot,2
12618,8.04E+11,39.6," leg side, he looks to turn it round the corner but it's glove and thigh pad rather than bat ... they don't care, it's a run and that's all that matters to the irish",3
12619,8.04E+11,39.5," o'brien back and over that, he did well as it got big on him but he was right on top of it",3
12620,8.04E+11,39.4," another good yorker but outside off stump, and again dug -999",3
12621,8.04E+11,39.3, worked down to third man,3
12622,8.04E+11,39.2," great yorker, shades of waqar in his pomp, but johnston got his feet -999 of the way and somehow dug it -999. superb and absorbing cricket all round",3
12623,8.04E+11,39.1, firm drive to extra cover,3
12624,8.04E+11,39.1," full toss down the leg side, akmal did really well to leap to his left and take that, it could easily have been five wides",3
12625,8.04E+11,38.6," short and a trifle wide,  o'brien stands tall and launches that between cover and extra cover, well timed and the fielders had no chance",5
12626,8.04E+11,38.5, short and o'brien ducks rather than hooks,5
12627,8.04E+11,38.4, huge cheer as the ball goes into the leg side and the batsmen scamper a -999,5
12628,8.04E+11,38.3, bat-pad or pad-bat ... a loud and rasping appeal for leg-before from the bowler but bowden not interested. it hit him in line but was possibly going over whatever order it hit in. good shout though and those have been given on other occasions,5
12629,8.04E+11,38.2," plopped up into space on the leg side, mid-on into field",5
12630,8.04E+11,38.1, johnston prods that to extra cover,5
12631,8.04E+11,34.6," is it get -999 of jail time? mccallan goes back, is turned square and a thick edge is well taken low down by younis khan at second slip. good bowling and a slick catch",5
12632,8.04E+11,34.5," short, white seemed slow to pick it up and he could do no more than spoon the catch to hafeez at short leg",5
12633,8.04E+11,34.4, pushed to mid-off,5
12634,8.04E+11,34.3," full on leg stump, and an explosion of noise as he clips the ball off his toes to the left of the man at long leg who cannot get round to save the -999",5
12635,8.04E+11,34.2," too far down the leg side, off the hip to long leg",5
12636,8.04E+11,34.1, pushed into the off side,5
12637,8.04E+11,28.6, neatly worked into the leg side as the more set o'brien milks the strike,3
12638,8.04E+11,28.5, back and a hint of a thick edge as the ball scoots to gully,3
12639,8.04E+11,28.4," o'brien back and pushed to cover, takes a big stride and then screams 'no'",3
12640,8.04E+11,28.3, outside off and no nibble from o'brien,3

12644,8.04E+11,22.5, pushed defensive shot to cover,3
12645,8.04E+11,22.4," good footwork again, he meets the ball on the half volley and works it through midwicket",3
12646,8.04E+11,22.3, he stays creasebound this time and blocks,3
12647,8.04E+11,22.2, another big step and driven through the covers,3
12648,8.04E+11,22.1, o'brien uses his feet to drive to mid-on,3
12649,8.04E+11,19.6," speared into porterfield's midriff, mahmood follows through and the batsman and bowler exchange some opinions on life in general and that delivery in particular",2
12650,8.04E+11,19.5," neatly worked to mid-on with soft hands, all the pace off the ball and an easy run",2
12651,8.04E+11,19.4, back and slightly hurriedly blocked,2
12652,8.04E+11,19.3," outside off, no shot",2
12653,8.04E+11,19.2," off the bat and then pad into the leg side, a moment's hesitation and although midwicket scored a direct hit, o'brien was well home",2
12654,8.04E+11,19.1," chopped into the off, well stopped by a wrong-footed nazir",2
12655,8.04E+11,12.6, too wide to tempt,2
12656,8.04E+11,12.5," swinging in to the batsmen, and as a result the drive went more to leg than porterfield intended and the ball ended up with mid-on",2
12657,8.04E+11,12.4," lovely ball, through the drive ... he was beaten all ends up by that -999",2
12658,8.04E+11,12.4, more loud cheers ... billy b signals the wide as the bowler veered to the off,2
12659,8.04E+11,12.3," driven straight, hafeez at mid-off dives to his left but cannot pick it up cleanly and the ball bobbles far enough -999 from him to allow the -999",2
12660,8.04E+11,12.2," swinging, but it started too far outside the off stump to interest anyone",2
12661,8.04E+11,12.1, firm drive back at the feet of the bowler who is down quickly to pick it up,2
12662,8.04E+11,10.6, porterfield into line and meets the ball with the full face of the bat,2

12667,8.04E+11,10.1," better line, around off stump and patted into the off side",2
12668,8.04E+11,10.1, he starts with a leg-side wide to loud and sarcastic cheers from the irish,2
12669,8.04E+11,9.6, he went for it but it was a yard too full and a foot too wide,1
12670,8.04E+11,9.5, porterfield again forced onto his toes to get over the ball and run it into the gully area,1
12671,8.04E+11,9.4," short, but even so got big and porterfield did well to keep that down from in front of his face",1
12672,8.04E+11,9.3, outside off and left alone,1
12673,8.04E+11,9.2," another rasping off drive, but this time the fielder is in the right place and so saves himself a long walk to the rope",1
12674,8.04E+11,9.1," short and slashed over the slips, it bounces a yard in front of gul at third man, he misfields but leaps back to stop the ball a yard from the rope. the batsmen thought that was going for -999 and so stopped running. good recovery from gul ...",1
12675,8.04E+11,1.6," good ball, batsman into line and blocks",3
12676,8.04E+11,1.5," a loud and raucous yell for leg-before as a yorker spears in at leg stump, it hit porterfield on the foot but again the umpire gave the run as the ball squirted -999 on the leg. hawkeye says that was -999 and it certainly was ...",3
12677,8.04E+11,1.4," leg side again, wraps bray on the thigh pad - it again seemed to be through him when he played it - and bobbles down to long leg. a run given ... not sure how",3
12678,8.04E+11,1.3," swinging into the left hander at 90mph, bray aims an expansive drive and plays outside it ... it also did him for pace",3
12679,8.04E+11,1.2," leg side, looping off the pad behind square and a few gasps as the pakistan supporters momentarily thought it might have been a catch",3
12680,8.04E+11,1.1," nice, just short, quick (88mph) and that trampolined through to akmal who took it at throat height",3

12698,8.04E+11,45.6, wow! this -999 has disappeared over long-on. the assault is getting ferocious minute by minute. a fullish delivery outside off stump was swung over long-on.,14

13220,8.04E+11,34.6," too full and wide, creamed to extra cover. that'll sting but a good stop",1

13985,8.04E+11,32.6, plays that -999 down off the back foot behind point,2
13986,8.04E+11,32.6," anderson wings that -999 down leg, his head right down as usual as he released it, and the batsman gamely chases, but is too late on the shot",2
13987,8.04E+11,32.5," drifts into the leg and he tries to rush that -999 to square, but doesn't time it properly",2
13988,8.04E+11,32.4, overthrow potential there and vaughan's hands are on his head as he misses that -999,2
13989,8.04E+11,32.3," outside off and that's played off the back foot  into the covers - a mix-up and that really should have been run -999, but bell's throw to anderson was a bit too hesitant, and his own work was hesitant as well",2
13990,8.04E+11,32.2," straight, a touch of room allows the righthander to work that to leg, but falls over a bit in that shot",2
13991,8.04E+11,32.1, played down to gully and that's straight to the fielder,2
13992,8.04E+11,31.6, on middle-and-leg - much better montyness and it's firmly defended,6
13993,8.04E+11,31.5," the wrong line from monty, on leg stump and it's easily swept",6
13994,8.04E+11,31.4, driven -999 to deep cover,6
13995,8.04E+11,31.3," just short of a length, crashed behind square - too wide and it gets what it deserves. a big -999.",6
13996,8.04E+11,31.2, pushed back to the bowler,6
13997,8.04E+11,31.1, play and a miss! very close,6
13998,8.04E+11,26.6," ooh much better appeal here, and it looks -999 - but pete parker turns it down! good grief, cricket's an odd game. that was plumb",3
13999,8.04E+11,26.5," half-an-appeal, and it's -999! what a bizarre shout for lbw. angling into the batsman - big inswing, which probably caused the doubt in flintoff's appeal who, like us, perhaps thought it was drifting down leg. but mid-appeal, he ramped it up to 11 and roared the question with fervour. and up went the finger",3
14000,8.04E+11,26.4," ah, neat stroke, really well timed but straight to long-off",3
14001,8.04E+11,26.3," calmly, if meekly, prodded past midwicket and they jog a -999",3
14002,8.04E+11,26.2," spearing into the batsman - half a shout from flintoff. 'how's?' was all he could shout, though nixon did manage to complete the appeal with a more erudite 'owsa?' as he is rapped on the pads",3
14003,8.04E+11,26.1," well, once again flintoff wobbles this down the leg side and it's easily worked to leg",3
14004,8.04E+11,25.6," good end to the over as this flat, quick ball can only be punched straight to cover",2
14005,8.04E+11,25.5, timed into the covers,2
14006,8.04E+11,25.4, ooh nearly! mistimed back to monty who dived to his right and very nearly took a blinder,2
14007,8.04E+11,25.3," too short from monty, and too flat - the batsman just uses the pace of the ball to whip it through midwicket",2
14008,8.04E+11,25.2," punched, without power, to mid-off",2
14009,8.04E+11,25.1," on off stump, he comes forward and drives it cleanly into the covers",2
14010,8.04E+11,24.6," and he's right behind this -999, blocking it -999 like a bouncer rejecting a teenage alcopop-drinker on a friday night",4
14011,8.04E+11,24.6," down the leg side. no, no, no. wide",4
14012,8.04E+11,24.5, short and pulled around the corner to anderson at deep square leg who pings in a decent throw,4
14013,8.04E+11,24.4," swinging into the batsman who misreads it, trying to flick it over midwicket, he loses his balance and is rapped on the pads",4
14014,8.04E+11,24.3," brick-walled back to the bowler - but a good line, this, from flintoff, just on his off stump",4
14015,8.04E+11,24.2," wider of the crease, just a touch; full, spearing into him and it's very neatly driven indeed, timing it well past the infield and -999 to the extra cover boundary",4
14016,8.04E+11,24.1, quickish but too straight and it's nudged off his legs,4
14017,8.04E+11,21.6," clunked to cover. not a properly timed clunk, either, and it meekly bobbles -999",6
14018,8.04E+11,21.5," again short and he paddles it around the corner to monty at fine leg who receives cheers, for no reason in particular",6
14019,8.04E+11,21.4, pulled square,6
14020,8.04E+11,21.3," outside off, wide, and a firm outside edge races through third man",6
14021,8.04E+11,21.2, driven into cover,6
14022,8.04E+11,21.1," defended down off the back foot, straight and true",6
14023,8.04E+11,15.6, played back to the bowler,2
14024,8.04E+11,15.5, played in front of square,2
14025,8.04E+11,15.4, worked down off the back foot to midwicket,2
14026,8.04E+11,15.3, slower ball and that's driven over the top of cover,2
14027,8.04E+11,15.2," good slower ball, right up there and that's defended forward",2
14028,8.04E+11,15.1," huge, straight bouncer and for some reason that wasn't called wide",2
14029,8.04E+11,10.6, pushed to mid-off,8
14030,8.04E+11,10.5," edged! well, was that intentional? perhaps. -999'll give it to the batsman. a firm slash which races between keeper and slip",8
14031,8.04E+11,10.4," ah, there we go, that's what tikolo was attempting the previous ball. he crashes this in front of square for -999",8
14032,8.04E+11,10.3," cut, hard, but straight to point. a loose delivery from anderson which deserved -999, but tikolo finds point",8
14033,8.04E+11,10.2," ooh, very well bowled! late inswing, at impressive pace, and tikolo defends off the back foot",8
14034,8.04E+11,10.1," swinging into the batsman, who pushes at it off the back foot to collingwood at mid-on. a shimmy to his right, and he takes the simplest of catches",8
14035,8.04E+11,5.6, and it's left alone outside off,5
14036,8.04E+11,5.5," firmly defended on the front foot, coming right forward - head over the ball, and a resounding ping of the bat is heard as he clamps down on it",5
14037,8.04E+11,5.4," full, fast, outside the off stump and it's very neatly guided past gully down to third man",5
14038,8.04E+11,5.3," ooh and it's full, fast, straight and squirted -999 into the covers",5
14039,8.04E+11,5.3," that's more like the flintoff of old, outside off and it passes by his outside edge",5
14040,8.04E+11,5.2," better line this time, swinging into the batsman's pads on off stump and, belatedly, flintoff half-roars an appeal",5
14041,8.04E+11,5.2," again he drifts this down the leg side, again they pick up a -999",5
14042,8.04E+11,5.1," wrong line, on leg stump and they steal a leg-bye-bye",5
14043,8.04E+11,26.6, turned around the corner and there's his 13th -999-day fifty,5
14044,8.04E+11,26.5," pushed, with no great power, into the covers",5
14045,8.04E+11,26.4, turned to leg,5
14046,8.04E+11,26.3," pietersen comes forward, massively, head over the ball and works it to leg",5
14047,8.04E+11,26.2, worked to leg,5
14048,8.04E+11,26.1," worked with a flourish of the bat to midwicket, in comes the throw as they take -999 - oh dear, joyce is struggling, but it's not gathered in very well and he's safe",5
14049,8.04E+11,19.6, well waited for a gentle dink patted through midwicket,14
14050,8.04E+11,19.5," hmm, third umpire called in to adjudicate if bhudiya, the sub, cut that -999 off inside the midwicket rope. and he did",14
14051,8.04E+11,19.4," outside off and smashed, against the spin, through midwicket. 'he's a freak,' declares willo",14
14052,8.04E+11,19.3, worked off the front foot into midwicket,14
14053,8.04E+11,19.2, helped -999 to just inside the boundary,14
14054,8.04E+11,19.1, on -999 knee and swept to square leg,14
14055,8.04E+11,11.6," dabbed off the hips, tamely enough, into shortmidwicket",13
14056,8.04E+11,11.5, short and that's just lifted -999 off the hips for the maximum. just needs an 8 next ball then we can appreciate... etc,13
14057,8.04E+11,11.4," on off, good length, and joyce defends with a straight bat, downwards",13
14058,8.04E+11,11.3, commanding punch -999 off the back foot and that travels,13
14059,8.04E+11,11.2," turned off the hips in front of midwicket, well timed there by joyce",13
14060,8.04E+11,11.1," on middle and there's a loud shout for a run -999, but the throw comes in too late and pietersen was safely home, in fact he was pretty much tucked up in bed by the time that -999 came back",13
14061,8.04E+11,1.6, solidly forward and pushed -999 square of the -999,4
14062,8.04E+11,1.5, too wide of the off stump; joyce again leaves alone,4
14063,8.04E+11,1.4," better line just outside off, joyce watches it pass by",4
14064,8.04E+11,1.3," oh, delicious shot, an elegant check-drive through cover for -999. pure timing",4
14065,8.04E+11,1.2," fuller this time, allowing joyce to defend it with caution on the front foot. 'no run' is the call",4
14066,8.04E+11,1.1," good start, but a good leave from joyce. just short of a length, joyce leaves well alone and it takes the wicketkeeper by surprise, spitting up at him and he takes it head height",4
14067,8.04E+11,0.6," very nicely bowled indeed, that's the line to vaughan. angling in on middle-and-off, cutting -999 at the last minute but vaughan clamps down on it",1
14068,8.04E+11,0.5, tucked off his hip for a -999 just behind square. odoyo's lines rather inconsistent so far,1
14069,8.04E+11,0.4," cracking ball! terrible shot, mind...just feeling for it outside off. very wafty.",1
14070,8.04E+11,0.3," just short of a length, joyce goes back and defends on the back foot",1
14071,8.04E+11,0.2," on middle stump this time, joyce comes forward to defend on the front foot",1
14072,8.04E+11,0.1," on leg stump, joyce comes forward and rather falls -999 in the process and nudges it to leg",1
14073,8.04E+11,19.6," flighted on off, hurdle is rooted to the crease and swings and misses",8
14074,8.04E+11,19.5," fired on middle and leg, tucker slogs, the ball flies towards long leg who takes a well judged catch, bangaldesh have been very quick on the field",8
14075,8.04E+11,19.4," tucker gives room and the outside edge flies towards third man boundary, who was brought forward",8
14076,8.04E+11,19.3," scooped to deep cover and rasel makes a valiant attempt at catching that, diving forward",8
14077,8.04E+11,19.2," on middle and leg, minors pushes it to long-on",8
14078,8.04E+11,19.1," tucker gives room again, whacks it to long-off",8
14079,8.04E+11,4.6," beaten again! that was a jaffa, overpitched, it swung -999 after pitching and pitcher nearly edged it while trying to drive off the front foot",3
14080,8.04E+11,4.6," beatenh again, this -999 sliced pitcher in half but mortaza overstepped, the ball clips the pads to the keeper",3
14081,8.04E+11,4.5," beaten! pitcher was drawn into another waft just outside off, nearly gets the edge to mushfiqur",3
14082,8.04E+11,4.4," mortaza maintains the straight line, pitcher pushes it firmly to mid-on",3
14083,8.04E+11,4.3," straight delivery on the pads, pitcher clips it off his pads towards square leg",3
14084,8.04E+11,4.2," beaten! mortaza bowls a teaser in the channel outside off, pitcher wafts at it but withdraws his bat",3
14085,8.04E+11,4.1," mortaza strikes again, good length on middle at a gentle pace, borden shapes to play on the on side, ends up getting a leading edge, habibul bashar at mid-off takes a dolly",3
14086,8.04E+11,0.6," first blood to mortaza, dug in short, outerbridge was tempted into the hook, the ball catches the top edge and goes straight down the throat of mohammad rafique at fine leg",2
14087,8.04E+11,0.5, short of a length and outerbridge defends solidly off the back-foot,2
14088,8.04E+11,0.4," mortaza bowls that on middle and leg, tucked off the pads for no run",2
14089,8.04E+11,0.3," mortaza picks up a bit of pace, pitcher nudges it to third man",2
14090,8.04E+11,0.2," fullish outside off, swinging in, driven off the front foot to mid-off",2
14091,8.04E+11,0.1," drifting on the pads, warm-up delivery by mortaza, tucked -999 to the on side",2
14092,8.04E+11,17.3," and that's the passport to the super eights for bangladesh! saqibul hasan steps down the track lofts over mid-on for a boundary, man aren't the bangladeshis delighted!",5
14093,8.04E+11,17.2, turned -999 with ease towards the short fine leg region,5

14096,8.04E+11,7.5," fullish, driven off the front foot to cover",5
14097,8.04E+11,7.4," too close to cut, ashraful doesnt get the desired room to play it square and cuts it to third man",5
14098,8.04E+11,7.4," and another, mukuddem finding it hard to control the swing, slips down leg",5
14099,8.04E+11,7.4," direction wrong again, ashraful lets -999 go wide outside off stump",5
14100,8.04E+11,7.3," outside edge, saqibul edges to third man, safe shot in the end",5
14101,8.04E+11,7.2," low full toss, ashraful gets forward and pushes it gently to mid-on",5

14105,8.04E+11,6.4," how did that miss again?! good length on off stump, shaping in, saqibul misses and the ball misses the top of off stump by a whisker",7
14106,8.04E+11,6.4," now he goes on the off side, too wide for saqibul to make contact",7
14107,8.04E+11,6.4, another extra! hurdle slips this -999 down leg,7
14108,8.04E+11,6.3, turned -999 towards the on side for an easy -999,7

14118,8.04E+11,45.6, he oversteps and thats a freebie,17
14119,8.04E+11,45.5," hayden you beauty! 150 is up for the big man! tossed up outside off stump, real slow, hayden isnt to the pitch but backs himself to clear the ropes, and he does so with ease, swatting this high over cow corner for another dinger!",17
14120,8.04E+11,45.4," shot! uses the pace, jamming the bat down, with an open face, and runs it down to third man for -999",17

14127,8.04E+11,44.3," now he goes off side, making room again to free the arms, and even though he loses control of -999 hand, he gets enough on it to hit it over extra cover for -999",19

14189,8.04E+11,38.2, outside off and that's dibbled into the covers,8
14190,8.04E+11,38.1, turn and bounce outside off and that's worked behind point,8
14191,8.04E+11,33.6," neat shot, walking into that and rushing it in front of midwicket for -999",14
14192,8.04E+11,33.5," overthrows - a desperate shy at the striker's end from watson after lara tried to sweep on -999 knee, not cleanly connecting",14

14200,8.04E+11,32.3, played -999 behind point,7
14201,8.04E+11,32.2," what a short, lara just waits and, well, that was magnificent - he deftly touches that -999 through the vacant first slip; deliberately and sweetly as you like. and you do like",7

14203,8.04E+11,30.6," short and lara connects cleanly, pulling that down to square",6
14204,8.04E+11,30.5," straight again, but ramdin takes a stride to off to swish it back to leg and there's an easy run there",6

14206,8.04E+11,30.3, width from mcgrath and that's hammered off the back foot with a crashing blow through cover. we like that,6
14207,8.04E+11,30.2, pushed into the covers,6
14208,8.04E+11,30.1," chops down and an inside edge crashes into the ground, threatening to take the off sticke. he gets -999 with it this time",6

14210,8.04E+11,19.5, defended into the covers this time,5

14212,8.04E+11,19.3," short and pulled strong, and brilliantly, in front of midwicket. not much wrong with that delivery from tait, just short of a length, but lara helps himself, and dismissively - disdainfully, even - swats that -999 -999",5
14213,8.04E+11,19.2," more grunting, like being at wimbledon on a bad day, and that's pushed right up there, the ball driven back to mid-on",5
14214,8.04E+11,19.1," more grunting, but it's straighter and that's defended down this time",5
14215,8.04E+11,19.1," grunts with the effort - 'ehh' - but still bangs that dully down leg, the batsman gamely swivelling round to have a go, yet is too late on the shot",5
14216,8.04E+11,14.6, strayed down off and that's played -999 to the man on the fine-leg boundary,4

14218,8.04E+11,14.4," on a good length, driven into the covers",4
14219,8.04E+11,14.3," on off, up there, and sarwan does well to even manoeuvre that into the leg-side, wristy wrists agogo, but yet again he can't pick the gap. -999 think the stump mic was turned off that time, just in case",4
14220,8.04E+11,14.2, pushed in front of midwicket,4
14221,8.04E+11,14.1," short, and sarwan latches on to it, sending it only as far as point. -999 can't relay what sarwan said, this being before the watershed, but let's just say his language was a touch industrial, frustrated at missing -999",4
14222,8.04E+11,12.6, worked -999 to a very wide fine leg,3
14223,8.04E+11,12.5, played -999 to point,3
14224,8.04E+11,12.4, jabbed down off the back foot,3
14225,8.04E+11,12.3," they look for a quick -999 off an inside edge and there's a direct hit but umpire rauf's into his position quickly and saw that the batsman was well in. the aussies half-heartedly appealed, there, but lara was so safely home he was up the stairs tucked up in his pyjamas",3
14226,8.04E+11,12.2," short and that's tickled into midwicket off the back foot, the batsman leaving his crease, but getting back quickly as he realises there's no run on",3
14227,8.04E+11,12.1," short, on off, and that's jabbed down off the back foot into the covers",3
14228,8.04E+11,11.6, driven slowly to mid off,1
14229,8.04E+11,11.5, defended down off the back foot,1
14230,8.04E+11,11.4, short and that's played down and round behind square,1
14231,8.04E+11,11.3, oozes that -999 into the short midwicket this time,1
14232,8.04E+11,11.2," even a mere push of a drive to mid-off, as with this -999 here, is sumptuous to watch. mcgrath bends his back, gets a fingertip to it, and does enough to take the pace off the ball",1
14233,8.04E+11,11.1," stays over the -999 to the lefthander, by the way, and lara jabs that -999 down off the back foot",1
14234,8.04E+11,10.6, off the mark at last with a tickle to midwicket,1
14235,8.04E+11,10.5, outside off and lara can leave that -999 easily enough. so he does,1
14236,8.04E+11,10.4," great channeling from bracken, on off this time, right up there and again lara is made to defend",1
14237,8.04E+11,10.3," even straighter, bang on middle, and lara shapes to work that -999 into the midwicket, quick hands as ever, but stops on the shot",1
14238,8.04E+11,10.2," jabs quickly down on to this -999, straighter, in line with off, and rising, so he plays off the back foot",1
14239,8.04E+11,10.1," that -999's darted down the off side, on a good length, and the batsman takes his arms and shoulders them",1
14240,8.04E+11,6.6," too straight, gayle works it off his legs to fine leg",1
14241,8.04E+11,6.5," good line, and full too, gayle defends it off the back foot",1
14242,8.04E+11,6.4, check-driven on the front foot to mid-off,1
14243,8.04E+11,6.3," pushed -999 with a greater flourish into the covers, but still no run",1
14244,8.04E+11,6.2, better. cutting back into gayle who is solidly behind it,1
14245,8.04E+11,6.1, left alone outside off. bracken continues with this annoyingly wide line of the off stump,1
14246,8.04E+11,3.6," the wrong line, drifting down leg and sarwan nudges it to leg to steal the strike",5
14247,8.04E+11,3.5," gone! full, straight, swinging into chanderpaul's pads who plays all around it",5
14248,8.04E+11,3.5," quick. quick ball, 91mph (146ish kph) outside off. chanderpaul goes for a caribbean slash, but misses it by miles",5
14249,8.04E+11,3.4," oh and chanderpaul goes on the pull here - too full to be pulling, perhaps? - gets it off the toe of the bat and it spoons in the air over the bowler. very fortunate not to find mid-on",5
14250,8.04E+11,3.3," full, swinging into him and gayle is finally off the mark with a squirted drive past the bowler",5
14251,8.04E+11,3.2," there's the line, on middle-and-off and swinging into gayle who is really hurried into a defensive poke",5
14252,8.04E+11,3.1," that's zipped past gayle's throat, albeit wide of his off stump...but an encouraging sign from tait, getting good bounce off a length",5
14253,8.04E+11,0.6," well, -999 think bracken can count himself lucky that wasn't called a wide. left alone outside off",1
14254,8.04E+11,0.5, left alone outside off - a little too wide of the off stump to trouble gayle,1
14255,8.04E+11,0.4," tighter line, but again there is prodigious outswing for bracken. gayle is wise to it now, and shoulders arms",1
14256,8.04E+11,0.3," oh well bowled, that's a boomeranging outswinger from bracken. immense lift, off a good length, too",1
14257,8.04E+11,0.2," ooh, there we go, angling into gayle before it swings -999 from him. gayle came forward, quite tentatively, but his firm forward defence was soundly beaten",1
14258,8.04E+11,0.1," and a poor start from bracken, firing this down the leg side. west indies are off the mark",1
14259,8.04E+11,0.1," better, but too wide of the off stump to trouble the left hander who watches it swing past him",1
14260,8.04E+11,47.6," fifty up for arnold. immensely valuable knock. fullish, outside off and cut down to third man",7
14261,8.04E+11,47.5," fullish, on the legs, arnold leans forward, wrists it behind square-leg. very well placed.",7

14272,8.04E+11,37.6," comes down the track, reaches the pitch and drives to long on",3
14273,8.04E+11,37.5, similar delivery and the same shot. no run.,3

14493,8.04E+11,1.1," and he's gone! he's shouldered arms and back goes his off stump! a terrific ball, just cutting back in to joyce who watches his stump flatten. it almost kept a little low, too, and rankin receives congratulatory slaps from all his team-mates",2
14494,8.04E+11,40.6," white steps to leg and aims to thump the ball back past the bowler, he gets it off the toe of the bat and anderson tumbles more than dives to his right to lie on the ball",10
14495,8.04E+11,40.5," full toss on leg stump, clipped to the deep square boundary where panesar fields",10
14496,8.04E+11,40.4, anderson recovers and finds roughly the right area,10
14497,8.04E+11,40.4," it's all going percy sonn ... flung down the leg side, johnston shimmies -999 of the way and nixon again has to dirty his blues to stop the ball",10
14498,8.04E+11,40.3," johsnton takes a step to leg and hammers the ball way over the midwicket boundary ... a dozen or so rows back, but banks of empty seats so no chance of spectator heroics",10
14499,8.04E+11,40.2," better, on the stumps and blocked",10
14500,8.04E+11,40.2," anderson's compass needs recalibrating ... that was speared down the leg side from wide in the crease, so it looked even worse than it was. nixon scurries across to field",10
14501,8.04E+11,40.1," punched off the back foot through the covers, the man in the deep mops up",10
14502,8.04E+11,38.6, johnston leans back and puts everything into a back foot pull which clears the square-leg boundary by some way,8
14503,8.04E+11,38.5, turned round to panesar down in the deep on the leg side,8
14504,8.04E+11,38.4," reverse sweep, misses the bat and loops up off the front pad, nixon takes and unleashes an appeal, supported by nobody else",8
14505,8.04E+11,38.3," well flighted, really tossed up at 42mph, johnston down the track and squirts it into the leg side",8
14506,8.04E+11,38.2, prodded into the covers,8
14507,8.04E+11,38.1," a good 10mph slower than panesar, pushed into the leg side",8
14508,8.04E+11,35.6," rapped on his pads but it's drifting down....no it's not, he's -999! taufel has raised his finger.",6
14509,8.04E+11,35.5," hurrah, at last - a -999. and a fine shot too, calmly lofting it over the top, inside -999, over cover. well played that man",6
14510,8.04E+11,35.4, swept to deep backward square leg. in perfect control of that stroke,6
14511,8.04E+11,35.3, turned around leg to mahmood,6
14512,8.04E+11,35.2, pushed to short midwicket,6
14513,8.04E+11,35.1," short and wide, cut with a flourish by kevin -999 to deep extra",6
14514,8.04E+11,32.6, defended on the front foot to end the over,6
14515,8.04E+11,32.5, worked to leg,6
14516,8.04E+11,32.4," done him in the flight there, balloons off his pad",6
14517,8.04E+11,32.3, drops this down in to the off side and scampers through for a -999,6
14518,8.04E+11,32.2, timed to long-on,6
14519,8.04E+11,32.1," and he skips down the pitch again, and works it to leg",6
14520,8.04E+11,31.6, worked off his legs for a -999,2
14521,8.04E+11,31.5," blimey, he's reverse sweeping here but it was far too quick for him",2
14522,8.04E+11,31.4, cut down to third man,2
14523,8.04E+11,31.3," close! he's rapped on the boot here - no he's not, he's rapped on the pads here but taufel turns it down",2
14524,8.04E+11,31.2, very flat and crunched straight to extra cover,2
14525,8.04E+11,31.1," a bit of spin there, but not a lot of bounce. worked to cover",2
14526,8.04E+11,30.6, neatly turned to mid-on,2
14527,8.04E+11,30.5, punched back to vaughan,2
14528,8.04E+11,30.4, calmly turned around the corner,2
14529,8.04E+11,30.3," ooh, careful - again he charges down the pitch like a man possessed, and only just gets his pad in the way. close to being stumped",2
14530,8.04E+11,30.2, a skip down the pitch and it's defended,2
14531,8.04E+11,30.1," on leg stump, turned around the corner",2
14532,8.04E+11,29.6, square-driven for a quick -999,3
14533,8.04E+11,29.5," slog-swept, but it's top-edged and skied to flintoff at mid-on who has to jog in about five metres, sliding down on his knees to take it grass-level",3
14534,8.04E+11,29.4, and he can't time it again,3
14535,8.04E+11,29.3, again too quick and it's whipped to leg. can't time it,3
14536,8.04E+11,29.2," and a play-and-a-miss! well bowled monty, rushing that past the left hander",3
14537,8.04E+11,29.1," late cut down to third man, very cannily played",3
14538,8.04E+11,26.6, swept - in the air! but it falls short of third man,3
14539,8.04E+11,26.5, rapped on the pads but that was well outside leg,3
14540,8.04E+11,26.4," and he hits it high, up in the air, but mahmood can't quite get there in time",3
14541,8.04E+11,26.3," flatter from vaughan, timed down to mid-on",3
14542,8.04E+11,26.2," again half a step down the pitch, driving it to mid-on",3
14543,8.04E+11,26.1, skips down the pitch before defending,3
14544,8.04E+11,19.6," wide, so much so that botha had to reach for it, and his slash to third man was quite safe",5
14545,8.04E+11,19.6," down the leg side, no real bounce either, and nixon takes the ball well as it scoots through to him",5
14546,8.04E+11,19.5," back on a conventional line and length, and treated with a conventional block",5
14547,8.04E+11,19.4," shorter and faster, it bounced more and went over the bat as botha leaned back and swiped",5
14548,8.04E+11,19.3," rather limp prod outside off stump, a poor shot, especially given that vaughan has brought in a slip",5
14549,8.04E+11,19.2," pushed to deepish mid-on, easy -999 despite a good, -999-handed pick up and throw",5
14550,8.04E+11,19.1, worked to deep square leg,5
14551,8.04E+11,15.6," tip-and-run, and a good -999 into the leg side",6
14552,8.04E+11,15.5, pushed gently to cover,6
14553,8.04E+11,15.4," pushed to backward point, bopara picks up and throws down the non-striker's stumps ... o'brien saw the danger and threw himself full length and made his ground by a yard",6
14554,8.04E+11,15.3," straight and right up to the bat, o'brien blocks cautiously",6
14555,8.04E+11,15.2, slower ball - 61mph - right through o'brien and nixon whips the bails off,6
14556,8.04E+11,15.1," collingwood gives a hint of width and o'brien on it so quickly to cut square. super shot, got what it deserved",6
14557,8.04E+11,14.6, mahmood bang on the button again,7
14558,8.04E+11,14.5, quicker - 87mph - and porterfield into line to defend up to short extra cover,7
14559,8.04E+11,14.4," once more to third man, this time panesar on it quickly and no more than the -999 this time",7
14560,8.04E+11,14.3," run down to third man, they spot panesar and take on his arm ... and win",7
14561,8.04E+11,14.2," -999 steps, a big swing, and inside edge onto pad, and the ball squirts close to the off stump and nixon dives to his left to gather",7
14562,8.04E+11,14.1," leg-stump line, the finest of tickles beats the man at long leg who was too square to cut it off",7
14563,8.04E+11,11.6," mistimed drive, the ball squirms off the inside edge into the leg side. a very ungentlemanly expletive is picked up by the stump mic ...",8
14564,8.04E+11,11.5," firm straight drive to the right of flintoff, pietersen at mid-on dives to his left and makes a tumbling -999-handed stop as the ball seemed almost past him",8
14565,8.04E+11,11.4," slanted across the left-hander, that's the line he is looking for and porterfield shoulders arms",8
14566,8.04E+11,11.3," flintoff once more drifts to leg, another confident flick to deep midwicket",8
14567,8.04E+11,11.2, worked off his hips into space on the leg side,8
14568,8.04E+11,11.1," lovely shot, a little width and hammered through the off side. timed beautifully and a classic stroke",8
14569,8.04E+11,8.6," much better from anderson - quite why he is incapable of bowling -999 balls in the same area is beyond me. on off stump and, believe it or not, it's defended",3
14570,8.04E+11,8.5," flayed on the up, zooting it down to third man",3
14571,8.04E+11,8.4," no no, wrong line. too straight, and anderson gifts -999 runs to a nudging nudge to leg",3
14572,8.04E+11,8.3," well bowled, but well left; pushing this across the batsman who almost shaped to play at it, before raising his arms",3
14573,8.04E+11,8.2," and it's on off stump, forward comes the batsman, pushing it calmly -999 into the off  side",3
14574,8.04E+11,8.1, defended -999 to point,3
14575,8.04E+11,4.6, and it's clunked to cover to end the over,0
14576,8.04E+11,4.5," ooh a fine delivery here, fine delivery passing by a rather indecisive forward  defence",0
14577,8.04E+11,4.4," full, driven to mid-off",0
14578,8.04E+11,4.3," down on -999 knee, a lovely looking drive but again it's hit straight to cover",0
14579,8.04E+11,4.2," crashed to cover, but straight to cover",0
14580,8.04E+11,4.1," on off stump, and splodged to mid-on",0
14581,8.04E+11,1.6," a lovely shot, check-driving mahmood but straight to mid-off",0
14582,8.04E+11,1.5," just short of a length, short enough for the batsman to rock back and defend off the back foot",0
14583,8.04E+11,1.4," ooh and another good piece of bowling; porterfield came forward, and just pulled his bat inside the line at the last moment",0
14584,8.04E+11,1.3," rapped on the pads, but he's hit outside the line",0
14585,8.04E+11,1.2," beaten. nicely bowled, just shaping across porterfield who wafts his bat at it ungainly",0
14586,8.04E+11,1.1," and it's short of a length, and quick (88mph, 142ish kph), left alone by the batsman",0
14587,8.04E+11,20.6," backs -999, full and fast outside off, swings and misses. gilchrist laps it up low",10
14588,8.04E+11,20.5, worked -999 on the leg side,10
14589,8.04E+11,20.4, punched down the long-on,10
14590,8.04E+11,20.3," loft. straight and full, in the slot. mashrafe lines it up and whistles it way over the bowler for a -999. that's brought the crowd to their feet. clean strike",10
14591,8.04E+11,20.2," backed -999, symonds drops it short and hoicks it for a -999 to midwicket",10
14592,8.04E+11,20.1, another full toss. is this some plan? it must be. mashrafe can't get hold of it and the thick edge flies to extra cover. doesn't carry and they take a -999,10
14593,8.04E+11,19.6, full ball again. can't do much with that. mashrafe drills it to long-off for a -999.,7
14594,8.04E+11,19.5," straight and full. punched -999 from the crease, wide of mid-on for a -999",7
14595,8.04E+11,19.4," back of a length, basher down the ground trying for the loft but misses.",7
14596,8.04E+11,19.3," yorker this time, homing in on off. basher digs it -999 back to the bolwer. short, slower, yorker. that's variety for you.",7
14597,8.04E+11,19.2," slow this time, outside off. mashrafe goes for the mighty hoick but an inside edge runs -999 behind square for a -999",7
14598,8.04E+11,19.1, short ball and straight but mortaza thwacks it. he backs -999 to the leg side and is followed by mcgrath but mortaza pulls it forcefull to the vacant midwicket region for a -999. fine shot,7
14599,8.04E+11,18.6," slower delivery again, angling into his pads, cracked -999 to the leg side for a -999. run-a-ball over that",6
14600,8.04E+11,18.5, basher down the ground and meets the ball on the full. ball flies off the thick edge to cover for a -999,6
14601,8.04E+11,18.4," full ball on middle, mashrafe backs -999 and thumps it to wide long-off for a -999. can't get the elevation because it's so full",6
14602,8.04E+11,18.3," slow ball, angling into middle. basher tries to go across the line but is deceived by the change of pace and gets an inside edge, onto his pads and gets a -999",6
14603,8.04E+11,18.2," full and angling into leg stump, flicked -999 for a -999 to square leg",6
14604,8.04E+11,18.1," another full toss. probably the outfield still slightly soggy, preventing the bowlers from gripping it. maybe, it's a plan. driven down the ground for a -999",6
14605,8.04E+11,14.6, right in the blockhole this time. saqib gives himself room but only digs it -999 and drives down the ground to long-off for a -999. good return for tait,4
14606,8.04E+11,14.5, this is a good length and line. gettiing pacier by the ball. driven to cover by saqib but can't pierce the field.,4
14607,8.04E+11,14.4," similar delivery, basher goes across the line but again gets an inside edge that deviates off the pads to third man. -999 again",4
14608,8.04E+11,14.3, gives himself room and slaps it to cover. tait keeping it full and straight. he's getting a hint of swing as well. better start to his second spell than his first,4
14609,8.04E+11,14.2, slowly cranking it up. full again and starting outside off and swinging in. basher goes for the drive but an inside edge richochets off his pads and trickles to the off side. they scamper a quick -999,4
14610,8.04E+11,14.1," starts off with a 145kph. full and straight. driven down the ground by basher, back to the bowler",4
14611,8.04E+11,10.6," slightly short and angling down leg, gilchrist turns it to the vacant short midwicket region. seven off the over. too easy now.",7
14612,8.04E+11,10.5," down the ground, flicked -999 behind square for a -999",7
14613,8.04E+11,10.4, good loop from over the -999 this time. pitches on leg and hayden pushes straight to the short fine leg,7
14614,8.04E+11,10.3, gives himself room but can't get the timing to blitz it past cover. finds the fielder and decides against the -999,7
14615,8.04E+11,10.2, tapped down the ground off the back foot. rafique drops it slightly short this time,7
14616,8.04E+11,10.1," flighted it straight, gilchrist down the ground and powers it to the right of cover. the ball is timed well and gets past the slow outfield for another -999",7
14617,8.04E+11,3.6, full again and struck to mid-off. the fielder is at the edge of the circle so they complete an easy -999,14
14618,8.04E+11,3.5," back of a length and outside off, not much room for gilchrist and he is slightly cramped for space as he tries to cut. drops down the pitch and the bowler cleans up",14
14619,8.04E+11,3.4," slightly slower, straighter too. gilchrist watches it carefully and punishes it past the bowler for another -999. ripper!",14
14620,8.04E+11,3.3," drilled down the ground crisply. too full and outside off, gilchrist on the front foot and cracks it past mid-off for a glorious -999",14
14621,8.04E+11,3.2," too wayward this time, down the leg side and full. gilchrist turns it -999 past the keeper for -999. fine leg inside the circle. poor line",14
14622,8.04E+11,3.1, driven to the off side for a -999,14
14623,8.04E+11,49.6," outside off again and that's the biggest shot of the day to bring up the 300! great shot from dilshan, striking that up, up and -999 over midwicket right into the stands",14
14624,8.04E+11,49.5," outside off and that's driven down the ground, for another poor misfield",14
14625,8.04E+11,49.4, outside off and he tries to sweep that to leg,14
14626,8.04E+11,49.3, outside off and that's driven off the back foot to cover,14
14627,8.04E+11,49.2, low full toss and that's driven on the up to the man at extra cover,14
14628,8.04E+11,49.1, outside off and that's driven off the back foot to point,14
14629,8.04E+11,48.6, another quick -999 to end the over and sri lanka have a chance to post 300,10
14630,8.04E+11,48.5, reverse swept behind square and that's an excellent shot indeed,10
14631,8.04E+11,48.4, outside off and that's driven to long-on,10
14632,8.04E+11,48.3, pushed right up there again and that's driven to cover,10
14633,8.04E+11,48.2, pushed up there and that's dug into the leg side,10
14634,8.04E+11,48.2, down leg but that's too wide,10
14635,8.04E+11,48.1, worked -999 to leg,10
14636,8.04E+11,46.6, swept finely to fine leg,2
14637,8.04E+11,46.5," on off, down on -999 knee, and that's swept, short, to square leg",2
14638,8.04E+11,46.4," oh dear, backed right -999 trying to make room and carved that -999 right up to lara at wide mid-off. selfless shot, though, really, trying to boost sri lanka late on",2
14639,8.04E+11,46.3," tries something different, seeing the batsman coming, and trying to send that wide down leg for the stumping - silva managed to get his pad on it",2
14640,8.04E+11,46.2, down on -999 knee and doesn't quite strike that -999 cleanly enough,2
14641,8.04E+11,46.1, round the -999 and the batsman looks to turn that -999 behind square,2
14642,8.04E+11,44.6, driven off the toes through midwicket,7
14643,8.04E+11,44.5," shorter ball, on leg, and that's worked in front of midwicket",7
14644,8.04E+11,44.4, late cut down to third man,7
14645,8.04E+11,44.3," even more room and that's driven very well to extra cover, but chanderpaul dives very well to make a very good save",7
14646,8.04E+11,44.2, a touch of width outside off and that's driven straight to the man at cover,7
14647,8.04E+11,44.1," brilliant yorker straight up, removes the off stick and jayawardene just smiles. there's not much celebration on the field, low key only, and that's the end of a fine innings from jayawardene",7
14648,8.04E+11,41.6, does well to work -999 a full ball right behind point,5
14649,8.04E+11,41.5, driven -999 aerially over cover,5
14650,8.04E+11,41.4, lovely shot - offering his bat and sweeping it low behind square,5
14651,8.04E+11,41.3, jayawardene would have been in trouble with a better throw from fine leg,5
14652,8.04E+11,41.2," liked that -999, testing the man with -999 which turned a bit outside off, and got the prod... but not the edge",5
14653,8.04E+11,41.1, driven -999 strongly,5
14654,8.04E+11,23.6, that's driven wide of mid-on and there's a bit of a chase for sarwan down there,7
14655,8.04E+11,23.5," over the -999, by the way, and that pitches straight and it's worked just in front of square off the toes, a tidy shot",7
14656,8.04E+11,23.4, shimmied off the toes behind square,7
14657,8.04E+11,23.3," customary cut behind point, well timed - a very decent shot for a -999, that",7
14658,8.04E+11,23.2," more convincing shot, opening his shoulders and briskly late-cutting that -999 behind point",7
14659,8.04E+11,23.1," zigzagging swing there, and the ball cuts back off the seam, too, with the ball on the rise - great ball and the batsman did well to get nothing on it",7
14660,8.04E+11,20.6," tidy ball ends the over, forcing the batsman to adjust his drive into a defence, again at the last second",4
14661,8.04E+11,20.5," tucks that -999 across and there are more overthrows, this time from smith, shying in and pretty wide of the stumps in the end, beating the man backing up behind the -999",4
14662,8.04E+11,20.4," comes down the track and ... defends, the batsman just adjusting at the last minute",4
14663,8.04E+11,20.3, played wristily down off the back foot behind point,4
14664,8.04E+11,20.2," presents the face of the bat and that's defended with a pleasant, clean 'clock' sound into the covers",4
14665,8.04E+11,20.1, dabbed down off the back foot behind point,4
14666,8.04E+11,11.6, shorter but still angled across jayasuriya who again leaves it,1
14667,8.04E+11,11.5," angled across the left-hander, not a sniff of movement and jayasuriya lets it pass",1
14668,8.04E+11,11.4, flicked off his hips to square leg,1

14849,8.04E+11,1.6," full in length, outside off stump, fulton leans forward, drives to cover",5
14850,8.04E+11,1.5," edged to third man boundary. fullish and slanting -999, fulton leans forward, pushes at it and edges it well past the second slip. all along the ground though.",5
14851,8.04E+11,1.4, again pushes that -999 outside off. he is yet to curve it back in.,5
14852,8.04E+11,1.3," full in length, just outside the off stump, driven to cover",5
14853,8.04E+11,1.3," pushes that wide outside off stump, wide called.",5
14854,8.04E+11,1.2," lands outside off stump, stays there, left alone",5
14855,8.04E+11,1.1," full and outside off, fulton leans forward, drives to mid-off",5
14856,8.04E+11,29.6, no... a short -999 - kallis again trying to get some lift -999 of a dull track - and that's greyly worked to square,3
14857,8.04E+11,29.5," bouncer, heading leg-ward though and boucher misses it, and the batsmen capitalise",3
14858,8.04E+11,29.4," the batsman moves back to give himself room to cut that ball to point - however... it dips on him, and is faster than he was expecting, so he cuts over it",3
14859,8.04E+11,29.3, driven -999 to mid-on this time,3
14860,8.04E+11,29.2," decent delivery that from kallis, round the -999 by the way, flirting through on a tempting length and come-to-bat eyes. just failed to grace the edge",3
14861,8.04E+11,29.1, dibbled that -999 down off the back foot into the covers and there's another -999,3
14862,8.04E+11,28.6," goes he softly into the light, hitting that full toss up to midwicket",5
14863,8.04E+11,28.5, down on -999 knee and eases that -999 to point for the gentlest of singles,5
14864,8.04E+11,28.4, down on -999 knee and this time the sweep is orthodox,5
14865,8.04E+11,28.3," more premeditation, more reverse sweeping, and this time he connects - but still not on the middle - with a swish square",5
14866,8.04E+11,28.2," premeditated reverse sweep, poor connection",5
14867,8.04E+11,28.1," should have been -999 there, with that dab cut -999 through the covers, but botha slipped on turning and had to get back to that crease",5
14868,8.04E+11,19.6, punched off the back foot,3
14869,8.04E+11,19.5," what a vicious delivery, spitting up at him. he had nowhere to go, the ball skying to square leg who took a simple catch. excellent change of pace there, but the -999 owed as much to the pitch's vagaries",3
14870,8.04E+11,19.4, dropped down into the leg side and they go for a -999...but morgan was ball watching and he has to scamper through to make his ground,3
14871,8.04E+11,19.3, cut off the back foot to third man. too wide.,3
14872,8.04E+11,19.2," huge appeal from hall, from boucher too, but it's turned down. no contact - appeared to be the bat hitting the pad which caused that dull-sounding thuddy noise",3
14873,8.04E+11,19.1," just angled, using the pace of the ball, behind square for a -999",3
14874,8.04E+11,17.6," dabbed down to third man. neat, calm stroke",6
14875,8.04E+11,17.5," my word, extreme bounce there. o'brien tries to uppercut it but it's far too short, and quick",6
14876,8.04E+11,17.4," again neatly square-driven -999 into the deep, but not quite as well placed",6
14877,8.04E+11,17.3," very well bowled, a quicker -999 which hurries past the batsman's meek backward-defensive-prod",6
14878,8.04E+11,17.2," better, tighter line this time and it's defended -999 to cover",6
14879,8.04E+11,17.1," shot. really fine shot indeed, he absolutely laced that square of the -999 - timing it beautifully. justin kemp was caught asleep on the boundary and, despite a dive, it was -999 all the way (as opposed to -999 half of the way)",6
14880,8.04E+11,16.6, cut down to third man,7
14881,8.04E+11,16.5, defended off the back foot to end the over,7
14882,8.04E+11,16.4," that rather spat up at him, again played with soft hands",7
14883,8.04E+11,16.3," ooh, outside edge - lovely ball - and it flies down to third man. neatly played, though, playing it as late as possible and guiding it.",7
14884,8.04E+11,16.2, drops this -999 into the off side,7
14885,8.04E+11,16.1," have some of that. full and he swings over the line and plonks him for -999, down to long on",7
14886,8.04E+11,16.1," that's filthy, miles wide of the off stump and o'brien nearly ruptures something vital in trying to reach it",7
14887,8.04E+11,11.6," driven uppishly, wide of the second slip - safe enough, and it zoots down to third man",2
14888,8.04E+11,11.5," cracked on the front foot square - oh, and a fine save from gibbs at backward point. that was -999 were it not for him",2
14889,8.04E+11,11.4," lovely ball on middle stump, just cutting a touch -999 from the left hander who is right behind it. again evidence of wobbly bounce, as that spat up on him",2
14890,8.04E+11,11.3," and that's guided down to gully who dives, and dives well to save a -999",2
14891,8.04E+11,11.2," very well bowled, on middle-and-leg - just a hint that that was shaping -999 from him, but he was quick to clamp down on it and nudge it to leg",2
14892,8.04E+11,11.1, the wrong line and it's tucked off his hip,2
14893,8.04E+11,2.6," short, rising on the batsman who just sways -999 of the way. just...",3
14894,8.04E+11,2.5," neat stroke; on leg stump, pushed through midwicket with pleasing timing",3
14895,8.04E+11,2.4," and he's immediately off the mark, as are ireland, whipping this off his pads down to fine leg",3
14896,8.04E+11,2.3," terrific bowling from pollock - that is absolutely plumb. cutting back into bray once more, and bray is rather trapped on the crease - trying to come forward, but without much conviction - and that's taking -999 middle",3
14897,8.04E+11,2.2," tries to work this off his pads to leg, and he sets off for a -999 - woops! no he doesn't, he turns on his heel - nearly rupturing his ankle in the process - and scampers back",3
14898,8.04E+11,2.1," well bowled indeed. ideal conditions for pollock here, and he just cut this -999 from bray who really felt for it outside off, just nibbling at it, not unlike a blind mouse in search of cheese",3
14899,8.04E+11,23.6, dragged it a touch short and that's worked to short midwicket,4
14900,8.04E+11,23.5, comes down with intent and that's driven to mid-on,4
14901,8.04E+11,23.4, nice flight and that's driven to cover,4
14902,8.04E+11,23.3, nicely played behind the -999 with a reverse sweep,4
14903,8.04E+11,23.2, driven back to the bowler,4
14904,8.04E+11,23.1, on leg and that's worked in front of square,4
14905,8.04E+11,22.6, driven back to the bowler who picks it up tidily,5
14906,8.04E+11,22.5, pushed up there by dave and that's driven -999 to cover for a -999 to bring up nelson,5
14907,8.04E+11,22.4," short and pulled gracefully, but without much power, behind square",5
14908,8.04E+11,22.3," straight, a touch short, and that's eased -999 on the front foot through midwicket",5
14909,8.04E+11,22.2," rushed up there, but there's a touch of width and it's driven from off into the leg-side",5
14910,8.04E+11,22.1, on middle and leg and a sweep to the on-side brings up his 61st -999-day fifty,5
14911,8.04E+11,15.6," nearly takes the edge here, good little spell from botha",1
14912,8.04E+11,15.5," swings in at gibbs who doesn't really have much room to play that -999, neither forward, nor back, but in the porch and he shunts it forward",1
14913,8.04E+11,15.4, worked to mid-on,1
14914,8.04E+11,15.3," slower delivery that couldn't have been more telegraphed and the batsman latches on to it with a cover-drive, but even so he doesn't time it properly",1
14915,8.04E+11,15.2," straighter, and dibbled down off the legs into the leg-side",1
14916,8.04E+11,15.1," sticks that -999 on a good length, but the batsman manages to drive easily enough to cover and they jog through a -999",1
14917,8.04E+11,12.6, pushed back to mid-on,4
14918,8.04E+11,12.5," oh no no no, don't bowl there. gibbs flangs it over cover with freeflowing goodness, available at tescos and all good retailers, for -999",4
14919,8.04E+11,12.4, again gibbs's head falls to the off side as he tries to work it through midwicket. and misses,4
14920,8.04E+11,12.3, pushed -999 to cover,4
14921,8.04E+11,12.2," a good -999 first up, spearing into gibbs whose head falls -999 - but fortunately it's attached to his body, and he survives to live another ball",4
14922,8.04E+11,12.1," what a catch! that is a quite brilliant, reflex snaffle from johnston. a full toss which smith hammered back to him, no more than -999 or five inches above the ground, and johnston plucked it -999 of the air",4
14923,8.04E+11,6.6, chopped down past point,2
14924,8.04E+11,6.5, kallis punches to mid-on but...straight to mid-on,2
14925,8.04E+11,6.4," but rankin strays here, like a city cat, down the leg side and smith turns it -999 for a -999",2
14926,8.04E+11,6.3," and that rather hurries onto smith, but he's well back in his crease and has enough time to jab down on it. kept a little low, that",2
14927,8.04E+11,6.2, bullishly worked to leg for a zero,2
14928,8.04E+11,6.1," good line from rankin, on middle stump - perhaps a touch too straight, but this is a mature opening spell so far. as all his opening spells in this cup have been",2
14929,8.04E+11,5.6, cut past point,9
14930,8.04E+11,5.5, a shimmy down the pitch and a skying-slap over long-off for -999,9
14931,8.04E+11,5.4, crunched to mid-off,9
14932,8.04E+11,5.3," powerfully clipped to leg but morgan is excellent at short midwicket, diving to his preferred left and saving at least -999",9
14933,8.04E+11,5.2," marvellous stroke there, pinging it past dave - dead straight - for -999. timed that beautifully",9
14934,8.04E+11,5.1, ooh close - a swing and a miss there and smith shakes his head in utter disgust (at the shot. not the ball or the bowler),9
14935,8.04E+11,1.6," the wrong line again from langford-smith, kallis turns him behind square for a -999",6
14936,8.04E+11,1.5," late swing for dave there, but too wide of the off stump to trouble kallis who shoulders arms",6
14937,8.04E+11,1.4," better line on middle stump, kallis tries to work it to leg but can't time or place it",6
14938,8.04E+11,1.3," a fine shot, just stroking it through extra cover. too wide; dispatched",6
14939,8.04E+11,1.2," well, smith won't miss -999 on those - and though he only gets a -999, it was a neat tuck off his pads",6
14940,8.04E+11,1.1, but dave wobbles it wide of the off stump and it's easily left alone,6
14941,8.04E+11,44.6," pushed into the covers, a scampered -999",9
14942,8.04E+11,44.5," full and well dug -999 down the ground, it's actually struck extremely well and bopara isn't helped by an outfield on the boundary edge which resemble a beach more than a cricket field",9
14943,8.04E+11,44.4," short and into arnold's body, he works it around the corner down to fine leg",9
14944,8.04E+11,44.3," drifting into the pads, dropped into the leg side but england won't mind the ones",9
14945,8.04E+11,44.2," driven past a diving cover, but it's only a -999 as mid off is up and runs round to complete the work",9
14946,8.04E+11,44.1, well outside off stump but arnold drives straight to backward point...good stuff from england,9
14947,8.04E+11,38.6, comes forward and there's a textbook forward defence,5
14948,8.04E+11,38.5," slower delivery and he's tempted to swish at it, misses though",5
14949,8.04E+11,38.4, just a touch of width outside off and jayawardene's eyes light up - but then so do joyce's in the deep - as the batsman smashes that aerially in front of midwicket,5
14950,8.04E+11,38.3," on leg and that's tucked off the legs behind square, a deft touch from jayawardene and panesar does his best with a sliding dive, but can't get there in time",5
14951,8.04E+11,38.2, driven to long-off this time,5
14952,8.04E+11,38.1," pitched right up there, straight, and that's defended forward",5
14953,8.04E+11,37.6," unconvincing attempt to take that from outside off and sweep it; misses completely, playing under the ball, down on -999 knee",4
14954,8.04E+11,37.5, driven to cover,4
14955,8.04E+11,37.4," dances down and drives that well in front of midwicket. there's some nifty running, too",4
14956,8.04E+11,37.3, a big backswing and that's driven straight to long-off,4
14957,8.04E+11,37.2," on middle and leg and does well to connect with the sweep, else that would have been a good shout, but picked the fielder",4
14958,8.04E+11,37.1, defended -999 to mid-on,4
14959,8.04E+11,35.6, defended forward,3
14960,8.04E+11,35.5," waits, waits, and uses the width to cut that through point, a lovely dink, and that's his half-century in 51 balls, his third against england",3
14961,8.04E+11,35.4," down on -999 knee to sweep early, mistimes it, but still sends it rolling to midwicket",3
14962,8.04E+11,35.3," driven -999 to cover, they think about running, but do the sensible thing and don't",3
14963,8.04E+11,35.2," typical panesar, zeroing in on a stifling delivery, with -999 which offers no room other than to defend",3
14964,8.04E+11,35.1, outside off and that's driven square to point,3
14965,8.04E+11,20.6," slower ball, if collingwood can get much slower, 60mph (100kph) and tharanga watchfully defends it under his nose",4
14966,8.04E+11,20.5," driven firmly up to mid off, jayawardene sets off straight -999 and despite a rocket throw from flintoff he gets in easily",4
14967,8.04E+11,20.4," short and wide, cut -999 but bopara makes another superb diving save at backward point, parries the ball to his right and there's a -999...but it could have -999",4
14968,8.04E+11,20.4, drifting down the leg side...that's the first wide of the innings,4
14969,8.04E+11,20.3," pitched on middle at a very gentle pace, tharanga pushes square into the covers",4
14970,8.04E+11,20.2," floated up outside off stump, just a hint of movement but firmly driven -999 through cover",4
14971,8.04E+11,20.1," starts with a near yorker, easily dug -999 by jayawardene",4
14972,8.04E+11,8.6," just outside off stump, tight stuff from anderson and tharanga covers up",4
14973,8.04E+11,8.5, back to the bowler with a straight bat,4
14974,8.04E+11,8.4," not convincing from tharanga, on middle and looks to keep a fraction low...gets a thick inside edge past the stumps and down to long leg",4
14975,8.04E+11,8.3," full and wide, tharanga opens his shoulders and drives handsomely behind square on the off side...panesar makes good ground from third man, slides and picks up...and gets a huge cheer from the england fans",4
14976,8.04E+11,8.2," goes across tharanga, left alone comfortably and through to nixon",4
14977,8.04E+11,8.1," on middle, tharanga plays from the crease down the pitch",4
14978,8.04E+11,7.6," gone! there's the breakthrough for england and it's the huge scalp of jayasuriya...mahmood kept his pace going, this -999 was tight on off stump and is defended with an angled bat and the ball crashes it the stumps. delight for mahmood and vaughan, who looks really pumped at that -999",7
14979,8.04E+11,7.5," goes very full this time, dug -999 into the covers",7
14980,8.04E+11,7.4," bouncer, jayasuriya gets a big top edge on it which flies fine and goes all the way for the first -999 of the day...the extra bounce in the surface helped that go for -999",7
14981,8.04E+11,7.3," ooh, nearly...short from mahmood and a little extra bounce surprises jayasuriya who tries to turn it through the leg side and gets a leading edge which falls short of mahmood in his follow through",7
14982,8.04E+11,7.2," gets behind this with a solid defence, back to mahmood",7
14983,8.04E+11,7.1," short, on the hip, and flicked down to long leg",7
14984,8.04E+11,4.6," well bowl, pushed across tharanga who feels for it and almost gets an edge...again nixon takes the ball on the rise",4
14985,8.04E+11,4.5," half volley, outside off stump and tharanga drives through the covers but without properly timing it...dribbles halfway towards the fence",4
14986,8.04E+11,4.4, encouraging carry for anderson as this -999 goes through to the keeper,4
14987,8.04E+11,4.3," comes forward and, like jayasuriya earlier, just pushes at the ball and it beats the infield through cover for a brace",4
14988,8.04E+11,4.2," there's the other -999, angles across the left-hander who lets in go",4
14989,8.04E+11,4.1," anderson keeps his good start going, on middle and played firmly up to mid on...but england need pressure from both ends",4
14990,8.04E+11,37.6," flicked to midwicket, can't beat the field",2
14991,8.04E+11,37.5," tighter to the body, dropped into the off side and they set off for a quick -999...nixon was watching bopara to make sure he was ok and nearly got caught short himself as dilshan threw down the stumps...replay shows he made by a foot or so",2
14992,8.04E+11,37.4," took quick for nixon, outside off stump and a wafty push and gets nowhere near it",2
14993,8.04E+11,37.3," hint of reverse swing, takes the pad and down the on side...fernando fields",2
14994,8.04E+11,37.2," uses his feet to the quick bowler, but all that effort only results in a drive to mid off",2
14995,8.04E+11,37.1," forced through the covers, deep cover cleans up",2
14996,8.04E+11,36.6, nice wrist work to send that into midwicket,6
14997,8.04E+11,36.5," top-edged sweep, falls short of the man at short fine-leg and is parried -999 by silva",6
14998,8.04E+11,36.4," very full, dug -999 into the covers",6
14999,8.04E+11,36.3," sweeps hard, but just a -999 -999 to deep square-leg",6
15000,8.04E+11,36.2," bopara playing very deep in his crease, dabs into the off side",6
15001,8.04E+11,36.1," and another reverse sweep from nixon, -999 to the deep fielder",6
15002,8.04E+11,33.6, big full toss but bopara can only work it to midwicket,1
15003,8.04E+11,33.5," it's all going on...the ball bobbles off nixon's body, bopara calls the run, nixon doesn't know where the ball is but the attempted kick misses the stumps...stick to cricket guys, rather than football",1
15004,8.04E+11,33.4," full and fast outside off stump, nixon doesn't get near it and it's a tough take for sangakkara",1
15005,8.04E+11,33.3," gone! and that almost certainly seals the deal...collingwood is trapped on the crease as fernando slips a quicker -999 through his defence. that was taking -999 middle half way up, no doubt about it...what a spell from sri lanka, who are showing why they are many people's favourites to win the world cup",1
15006,8.04E+11,33.2," batsmen crossed, collingwood defends this -999 towards point",1
15007,8.04E+11,33.1," gone! brilliant bowling from fernando, completely deceived by the slower ball, tries to go over mid on but only gets it as far as malinga on the edge of the circle and that puts sri lanka firmly in the driving seat",1
15008,8.04E+11,31.6," very full, searching for reverse swing, flintoff digs it -999 through midwicket and opens his account",3
15009,8.04E+11,31.5, flintoff looking edgy...plays from the crease and gets a thick edge into his pads,3
15010,8.04E+11,31.4, driven firmly but short cover makes an athletic save,3
15011,8.04E+11,31.3, forced back down the pitch,3
15012,8.04E+11,31.2," huge shout, so huge fernando falls over in his follow through...flintoff is caught on the crease but it's just shaping down the leg side",3
15013,8.04E+11,31.1, worked off middle stump -999 to deep square-leg,3
15014,8.04E+11,19.6," drifting onto the pads, tickled to short fine-leg where murali fields and clearly isn't fit...this could be a vital part of the match.",3
15015,8.04E+11,19.5, all defence from pietersen...some by-play with jayasuriya who made him wait,3
15016,8.04E+11,19.4," comes forward, soft hands, into the covers",3
15017,8.04E+11,19.3," touch short, cut -999 to deep cover",3
15018,8.04E+11,19.2," low full toss, firmly driven up the pitch and jayasuriya flicks it past the timber",3

15188,8.04E+11,6.6," terrific bowling this from bracken, it really is. and with gilchrist up to the stumps, bell is trapped - he just can't get it -999. pushed back to the bowler",0
15189,8.04E+11,6.5," it's full, it's straight, it's defended on the back foot",0
15190,8.04E+11,6.4," angled down just past hayden at first slip - who does brilliantly, leaping to his right like the salmon he is not",0

15193,8.04E+11,6.1," again bell advances down the pitch with impressive intent, but can't actually make anything of the ball. it bobbles -999 onto the leg side with meek intent",0
15194,8.04E+11,0.6," excellent line and length with which to finish the over, bell defending it with nervous-like energy, prodding it down and skipping down the pitch - threatening to run. but he doesn't",2
15195,8.04E+11,0.5," cut off the back foot, with pleasing timing, straight down into the ground and straight to clarke at point",2
15196,8.04E+11,0.4," good, nagging line from bracken here, just short of a length and wide enough for bell to leave - but there's a touch of shape back into the right hander here",2

15201,8.04E+11,44.5, bangs that -999 in short and that's pulled to panesar behind square,6
15202,8.04E+11,44.4, a bit too full from the bowler and it's timed very well to long-off to bring up his fifty from 59 balls; this is his 24th at this level,6
15203,8.04E+11,44.3, slight touch more width outside off and that's eased -999 off the back foot to the point boundary,6

15215,8.04E+11,41.3," really good effort from pietersen that - he caught it just inside the midwicket boundary and then he keeps tiptoeing and tiptoeing inside the rope, before flicking it into space inside as he goes over. there's much discussion and referral and many many replays. but not -999, in the end, he mustn't have been in control, in their opinion",13
15216,8.04E+11,41.2," symonds goes big; a slower ball, too short and that's launched off the back foot over the non-existent cow at cow corner",13

15355,8.04E+11,14.2, whipped -999 to the leg side for a -999. kevin gets off the mark,8
15356,8.04E+11,14.1," back of a length, defended down the -999",8
15357,8.04E+11,10.6," leans forward, left elbow high, pushes a fullish delivery to cover",0
15358,8.04E+11,10.4, bouncer. always dangerous . be in discotheque or on a cricket field. morgan starts to duck but it doesn't bounce as much as he expected and then sways -999 quickly,0
15359,8.04E+11,10.3," on a length, around off stump, not much room to work with, steered to point",0
15360,8.04E+11,10.2," just short of driveable length, outside off stump, pushed to mid-off.",0
15361,8.04E+11,10.1," on the leg and middle, attempts to whip it across, gets a inside-edge on to the pad",0
15362,8.04E+11,5.6," 137.-999 kmph, length-delivery, angling across and steered to backward point",4
15363,8.04E+11,5.6, slips down the leg side. another wide.,4
15364,8.04E+11,5.5," slower -999, on the middle stump, he picked it late but adjusted and worked it behind square-leg",4
15365,8.04E+11,5.4," full-pitched on the middle and off stump line, turned to the on side",4
15366,8.04E+11,5.3," pitched on a length, on the middle and off, moves -999, defended down the track",4
15367,8.04E+11,5.2," drifting on to the pad, flicked to fine -leg",4
15368,8.04E+11,5.1," full and straight, driven to mid-off",4
15369,8.04E+11,4.6," short in length, around off stump, steered to point",2
15370,8.04E+11,4.4," beaten again. franklin has troubled the batsmen whenever he has landed the ball on a length and brought it in a touch. not enough to damage the off stump. the batsmen seemed surprised by the angling in, and they have a hurried stab at it.",2
15371,8.04E+11,4.4," slower -999, low dipping full-toss, pushed to the off side.",2
15372,8.04E+11,4.3," teasing stuff. this -999 holds its line after landing in the zone outside off, morgan is up to the task, leaves it all alone",2
15373,8.04E+11,4.2," beaten. landed on a length, outside off stump, came in and he pokes at it.",2
15374,8.04E+11,4.1," full and on the off and middle stump line, shapes -999 a touch, porterfield thrusts his right leg across, tries to work it across the line, gets a outside edge, to third man",2
15375,8.04E+11,0.6," slightly short in length, outside off stump, and it keeps a touch low. porterfield pushes at it, gets a bottom edge on to the ground and it rolls to mccullum",2
15376,8.04E+11,0.5," beaten. in the zone outside off stump line, he pushes inside the line.",2
15377,8.04E+11,0.3," almost -999 ducks in a row for bray. he pushed to left of oram at point and rushed across. he stumbled midway, recovered and scrambled across. the throw came in flat and fast and he just about makes it in time. it was refered upstairs and not -999 was the verdict. that was close.",2
15378,8.04E+11,0.2," length-delivery, lands on the off stump line, came in with the angle, jabbed on to the pad.",2
15379,8.04E+11,0.1," full in length, on the off and middle, pushed towards mid-off and they steal a -999.",2
15380,8.04E+11,45.6," good, full delivery - following the batsman's movement to leg - and it's blocked -999",7
15381,8.04E+11,45.5, bump-balled over the bowler's head,7
15382,8.04E+11,45.4," dropped and that just about sums up west indies' day. it was short, gibbs went to pull it and got a top edge, skying it to bradshaw at third man who had just a few metres to run. and he shelled it",7
15383,8.04E+11,45.3," fine ball, full and straight - almost yorker length - but it's bump-balled over the bowler's head for a -999",7
15384,8.04E+11,45.2," on leg stump and flicked down to fine leg, and it's timed well too. but pollard makes up for his error in the previous over and saves -999",7
15385,8.04E+11,45.1," on off stump, the batsman takes half a step down the pitch and hammers it to cover who gets half a hand to it, preventing -999",7
15386,8.04E+11,34.6," a quick -999, this -999 to the gap in the covers",4
15387,8.04E+11,34.5," the batsman makes room, it's not a pretty sight as he backs -999 and clubs the ball towards cover - still, they get -999",4
15388,8.04E+11,34.4, pushed right up there and defended straight,4
15389,8.04E+11,34.3, turns -999 from the batsman outside off and that's cut to point,4
15390,8.04E+11,34.2, on the front foot and that's nibbled to point this time,4
15391,8.04E+11,34.1," over the -999, outside off and there's an outside edge which goes up and down, forlornly, nowhere near the fielder behind point",4
15392,8.04E+11,23.6," down on -999 knee, kallis launches into another drive but again lacks placement and it falls short of mid-off",4
15393,8.04E+11,23.5," fine shot, on the up, slapping him through the infield - but just for a -999",4
15394,8.04E+11,23.4," just short of a length, again de villiers gives himself a touch of room outside leg before flicking it, ungainly, to midwicket. no run there",4
15395,8.04E+11,23.3," and he's hit him. we've not had many batsman felled in this cup so far, and nor was kallis felled there...but the ball rocketed into his midriff following a mis-timed pull",4
15396,8.04E+11,23.2," a full toss which is pushed to cover. smashed would be more accurate but, either way, it was hit straight to the fielder",4
15397,8.04E+11,23.1, punched down the ground to long-on and there's his half-century,4
15398,8.04E+11,21.6, and he gives himself a touch of room outside off before timing it into the covers. but again he can't pierce the gap,2
15399,8.04E+11,21.5," full, straight  -  just slipping down the leg side and the batsman rather misses -999 here, the ball ballooning off his pad -999 into the off side",2
15400,8.04E+11,21.4, sliced on the front foot past backward point for -999. neatly placed,2
15401,8.04E+11,21.3, elegantly driven on the up but straight to cover,2
15402,8.04E+11,21.2," nearly! short of a length and he pulled it, got a bottom edge and it just fell short of lara at short midwicket",2
15403,8.04E+11,21.1, just angling back into the batsman who is back onto his stumps and defending it off the back foot,2
15404,8.04E+11,19.7," very low full toss bombs in at the shins, but that's flicked -999",14
15405,8.04E+11,19.6, pushes the batsman onto the back foot and that's squeezed into the covers,14
15406,8.04E+11,19.5, on leg and that's tucked -999 in front of midwicket,14
15407,8.04E+11,19.4," slower ball, de villiers picks it up early and sends that -999 over long-on with a bloody drive which just to say clears the rope and brings up his half-century",14
15408,8.04E+11,19.3, short and cut -999 strongly behind point,14
15409,8.04E+11,19.2," an easy -999 into the covers which brings up the hundred and that's trumpeted by ... well, the trumpeter",14
15410,8.04E+11,19.1, pushed up there and dug -999 from off stump to the covers,14
15411,8.04E+11,17.6, driven off the back foot straight to the man at point this time,4
15412,8.04E+11,17.5," up there and dug -999, driven into the covers, and that should have been a clear run--999 chance, but gayle failed to pick it up cleanly in the first place",4
15413,8.04E+11,17.4," goes for a -999 of the shot earlier in the over - this time the ball does have the height, but de villiers plays over it",4
15414,8.04E+11,17.3," short and wide again, but the ball's rising this time and kallis waits on tiptoes to lace that off the back foot through point",4
15415,8.04E+11,17.2," drags it down a touch short, and there's width, too; the batsman duly obliges with a cover drive but it's tidied up inside the rope",4
15416,8.04E+11,17.1, driven straight to gayle in the covers and the excellent fielder makes no mistake of course,4
15417,8.04E+11,13.6," walked across his stumps again and walked into that -999, flaying it in of midwicket with another strong drive",18
15418,8.04E+11,13.5," comes forward and walks across the bowler before the ball's even been delivered, turning that off his front foot to the midwicket boundary. pollard nearly got hold of it inside the boundary, but is honest in signalling -999 - his foot connected with the trope while the ball was still in his hand",18
15419,8.04E+11,13.4," superb shot, really superb. a touch wider and kallis just stepped back and gave himself room to launch that -999 over cover. that's the fifty partnership",18
15420,8.04E+11,13.2," short and that's gone just in front of point for a -999-bounce -999, a crisp aerial drive which doesn't go as straight as he'd like - in fact it went square",18
15421,8.04E+11,13.1," on a good length first up and pitching on off, pushing the batsman onto his back foot to defend",18
15422,8.04E+11,5.6, punched to mid-off,2
15423,8.04E+11,5.5," very well timed from smith, pumping it almost -999-footed to midwicket",2
15424,8.04E+11,5.4, classily driven on the front foot to cover,2
15425,8.04E+11,5.3," impressive pace from powell, de villiers almost steps to leg in leaving that -999 alone",2
15426,8.04E+11,5.2," but that's smith's bread and butter, on his leg stump and he turns it -999 down to fine leg. a fumble from bradshaw isn't costly",2
15427,8.04E+11,5.1," and again excellent swing for powell (if a swinging ball can be excellent), with this -999 swinging across the left hander who again is troubled by it, defending it off the back foot",2
15428,8.04E+11,4.6," de villiers walks into this defensive stroke, presenting the full face of the moon, and the bat, to the bowler",3
15429,8.04E+11,4.5," neatly clipped on his legs through the covers but lara is quick beyond his years, preventing -999",3
15430,8.04E+11,4.4," excellent ball, cutting -999 from smith but, to his credit, he read it well and left alone. too short to be driving, mind, which probably helped him in his decision",3
15431,8.04E+11,4.3," well bowled, swinging it into the right hander who is struck on the pads trying to work it to leg",3
15432,8.04E+11,4.2," a very ugly stroke, smith not moving his feet as he tries to clatter it through the covers",3
15433,8.04E+11,4.1," on off stump and smith is back, defending it with a high front elbow",3
15434,8.04E+11,0.6," down the leg side, off his pads and smith steals the strike",4
15435,8.04E+11,0.5, and smith goes for a chumping cut but can't time it and it bobbles -999 into the off side,4
15436,8.04E+11,0.4, again drifting down leg and it's turned off his pads for a -999,4
15437,8.04E+11,0.4, oh dear. the radar's battery juice is running -999 again. this -999 is wide of the off stump and called as such,4
15438,8.04E+11,0.4, down the leg side. and wided,4
15439,8.04E+11,0.3, wider of the off stump this time and it's left alone. a touch of outswing there for collymore,4
15440,8.04E+11,0.2," again well bowled, just short of a length and de villiers is back into his crease, flicking it with elastic wrists...but again he can't break the midwicket gap",4
15441,8.04E+11,0.1," and a good start from collymore, cutting this back into de villiers who initially looks for a run, but collymore leaps to his right to field",4
15442,8.04E+11,46.6, slower ball sails harmlessly down the off channel - nevertheless the batsman is tempted,2
15443,8.04E+11,46.5, driven -999 to long-on,2
15444,8.04E+11,46.4, reverse swing and the batsman uses the bat as a crutch and a defensive mechanism in stabbing down on the ball - top french cricketness,2
15445,8.04E+11,46.3," slower ball nearly ends the match, the batsman pulling back to give himself cutting room",2
15446,8.04E+11,46.2, drives that -999 to long-off where a smiling gibbs rolls it back underarm,2
15447,8.04E+11,46.1, on leg and collymore clips that nicely off the legs -999 to deep square and they're prevented from getting -999 by some great work from prince,2
15448,8.04E+11,36.6," and a good line again to finish the over, bradshaw just pushing it to mid-off",0
15449,8.04E+11,36.5, pushed off the back foot,0
15450,8.04E+11,36.4," on off stump this time, hurrying bradshaw who, crab-like, pokes it to leg",0
15451,8.04E+11,36.3," hammered off the back foot, a slicing cut short of gully",0
15452,8.04E+11,36.2, defended off the back foot,0
15453,8.04E+11,36.1, an ntini-length (just short of a good'un) which is guided to cover,0
15454,8.04E+11,29.6, bouncer crashes into his shoulder as he goes on the hook immediately,2
15455,8.04E+11,29.5," awful, awful. a straight -999 from kallis, on a good length, and pollard comes down the track to try to pull that through midwicket, yorks himself, tucks his bat under his arm and he's on his way. middle peg goes wheeling",2
15456,8.04E+11,29.4," cuts in, keeps low, and the batsman is beaten, leaning over his bat as he tries to play that -999",2
15457,8.04E+11,29.3," backs -999 from that -999, exposing all the sticks, and he does well to cut that behind point - hall doing well to keep them down to -999 from the deep",2
15458,8.04E+11,29.2," attempted bouncer and kallis ends up on his knees in the effort, that -999 pulled in front of midwicket",2
15459,8.04E+11,29.1," slower ball did him... but didn't quite get him - that -999 cutting back in ever so slightly, there's a big swing but he's through the shot before the ball arrived. got -999 with it",2
15460,8.04E+11,16.6, oh what a shot from lara. a good old fashioned bosh outside off - a laid-back carve through the covers - for -999,10
15461,8.04E+11,16.5, crashed to cover,10
15462,8.04E+11,16.4," better ball on off stump, angled down to third man",10
15463,8.04E+11,16.3," oh dear. nel is going to go berserk at this, drifting it down sarwan's leg side who just pulls it around the corner for -999",10
15464,8.04E+11,16.2," good line, just in the corridor outside off and it's pushed back to him",10
15465,8.04E+11,16.1, angling into the left hander who pushes it off the back foot,10
15466,8.04E+11,13.6, cracked to cover,5
15467,8.04E+11,13.5, loses his line here and lara nudges it through midwicket for a -999,5
15468,8.04E+11,13.4," terrific line from hall, on middle-and-off, forcing lara to defend",5
15469,8.04E+11,13.3," drifting down the leg side, it's worked off his pads for a shingle",5
15470,8.04E+11,13.2," just wide of the off stump and late-cut to backward point, gibbs, who makes a brilliant dive to his right to stop",5
15471,8.04E+11,13.1, turned off his hip for a quick -999,5
15472,8.04E+11,6.6, across the lefthander who strokes it easily to point,9
15473,8.04E+11,6.5," whisked -999 in front of square, where ntini chases that down inside the rope",9
15474,8.04E+11,6.4," they risk a -999 to long-off, this -999 hit too hard to allow them to get through comfortably; instead they get through uncomfortably. smith didn't miss by much and if he'd have hit, he'd have struck -999 gold",9
15475,8.04E+11,6.3," driven to cover where a slight misfield, from gibbs surprisingly, allows the run - some classic yesnoing going on beforehand",9
15476,8.04E+11,6.2," not much width really, but it's played late and square, really well played indeed, throwing the arms at that -999 and angling it -999",9
15477,8.04E+11,6.1, straight and that's a lovely straight drive back down the ground but it's cut off and they're kept to the -999,9
15478,8.04E+11,34.6," he really reaches forward to sweep the ball from a long way in front of him, keeps control and with it the strike",6
15479,8.04E+11,34.5," saqibul back and pulls that straight, short mid-on fields",6
15480,8.04E+11,34.4, pushed into the off side for a well-placed -999,6
15481,8.04E+11,34.3, panesar slows down - 46mph - but the batsman not tempted to try to -999 the up-and-over treatment,6
15482,8.04E+11,34.2, turned to backward point,6
15483,8.04E+11,34.1," full and wide, thumped with power up and over mid-off, -999 all the way. he really clobbered that",6
15484,8.04E+11,29.6," that -999 comes in again at the lefthander, but rushes past his shoulder without too much alarm",1
15485,8.04E+11,29.5, driven to the covers,1
15486,8.04E+11,29.4," similar ball, similar result",1
15487,8.04E+11,29.3," a good line again, that -999 coming right in at the lefthander, following him, and he has to play down in defence",1
15488,8.04E+11,29.3, that -999 seams in at the lefthander - and over his head,1
15489,8.04E+11,29.2, defended down to the men around point,1
15490,8.04E+11,29.1," round the -999, that -999 comes back in at the lefthander off the seam and that's tucked -999 to cover",1
15491,8.04E+11,22.6, stays over the -999 and that's driven to mid-off,1
15492,8.04E+11,22.5, driven into the covers and there's a quick -999,1
15493,8.04E+11,22.4, opens his shoulders and drives to cover,1
15494,8.04E+11,22.3, that -999 swings -999 past the righthander's deadly flashing blade,1
15495,8.04E+11,22.2," huge appeal for -999 which collingwood thinks has run -999 the non-striker, his fingertips grazing the ball on its way through to taking off the bails. -999 or -999 replays only needed to confirm he was safely home",1
15496,8.04E+11,22.1," may be dibbly, but that's right on a good length and that -999 can only be defended on the front foot",1
15497,8.04E+11,18.6," swept from middle stump to deep square leg, no risk as even had he missed he was a long way forward",5
15498,8.04E+11,18.5," short and wide, saqibul steps back and cuts neatly behind square,  a big gap there and he found it well",5
15499,8.04E+11,18.4, -999 steps down the track and then blocked,5
15500,8.04E+11,18.3, very correct forward defensive,5
15501,8.04E+11,18.2," saqibul forward, the ball squirts off the outside edge along the ground to short third man",5
15502,8.04E+11,18.1," outside off stump, no turn, saqibul lunges and misses",5
15503,8.04E+11,15.6," fuller, pushed firmly to cover and collingwood round to field",2
15504,8.04E+11,15.5," anderson spots that and digs another -999 in just short, mortaza jumps and prods to point",2
15505,8.04E+11,15.4," short and extra bounce, mortaza steps back and prods. that was more about self-defence than giving himself room",2
15506,8.04E+11,15.3," forward, punches to cover",2
15507,8.04E+11,15.2," aftab's brief cameo ends, a good-length delivery which he looks to drive, but he only succeeds in getting a thickish edge and nixon does the rest",2
15508,8.04E+11,15.1," too full and leg-stumpish, aftab flicks to backward square leg",2
15509,8.04E+11,14.6," flintoff offers too much width, saqibul leans back and hits than up and over backward point - a quite deliberate shot - and it bounces a foot over the rope",9
15510,8.04E+11,14.5," short, a bit more bounce than expected, safely plopped into the off side",9
15511,8.04E+11,14.4, saqibul back - and a hint of a step to leg - and he pushes the ball gently to cover,9
15512,8.04E+11,14.3," wide and slashed in the air to third man, pietersen gallops 20 yards to his left and makes a good pick-up on the run right on the rope",9
15513,8.04E+11,14.2, saqibul pushes to cover,9
15514,8.04E+11,14.1," turned to midwicket, another -999 there for aftab. he's faced -999 balls and all eight of his runs have come in the same area",9
15515,8.04E+11,13.6," short and at saqibul's body, he does well to get up on tip toes and keep that down",7
15516,8.04E+11,13.5," saqibul once more driven onto the back foot. that's the length anderson needs to bowl, forcing the batsmen back",7
15517,8.04E+11,13.4," a much better length, saqibul forced back to defend",7
15518,8.04E+11,13.3," anderson too full again, and once more aftab helps himself to easy runs through midwicket, sweetly clipped off his toes",7
15519,8.04E+11,13.2," confident start from aftab, whips the ball off middle and off, through midwicket and -999 all the way",7
15520,8.04E+11,13.1," super start, good line and length, ashraful spars at -999 that bounced and nixon holds an oh-so-simple catch. steve bucknor doesn't even have to delay and decide as ashraful is quickly on his way",7

16039,8.04E+11,26.6," flat, he goes back and drives to short extra cover",2
16040,8.04E+11,26.5," tossed up, symonds drives back down the track, jayasuriya reaches -999 to his right, the ball kisses his fingers, and ricochets onto the stumps, the decision is referred and its decided that ponting was just back in...whew, was close",2
16041,8.04E+11,26.4," flatter, shorter, he goes back and cuts into the covers, finding the gap and collecting -999",2
16042,8.04E+11,26.3," tossed up, defended off the front foot",2
16043,8.04E+11,26.2," tossed up, defended off the front foot",2
16044,8.04E+11,26.1," tossed up on off stump, driven to tharanga at short midwicket",2
16045,8.04E+11,25.6," looped up, he too uses the feet and drives it down to long-off",7
16046,8.04E+11,25.5," fired in on leg stump, symonds drives back to bandara",7
16047,8.04E+11,25.4," flatter on middle and leg, nudged to square leg",7
16048,8.04E+11,25.3," tossed up, ponting uses the feet and on-drives to fernando at mid-on",7
16049,8.04E+11,25.2," looped up, he waits for it and finds the gap behind point for -999 runs, well cut",7
16050,8.04E+11,25.1," flatter length, he goes back and punches to cover",7
16051,8.04E+11,22.6," flat on the stumps, he adjusts and punches down to long-on for -999",2
16052,8.04E+11,22.5," tossed up, clarke gets forward and then back, cutting to backward point",2
16053,8.04E+11,22.4," flat and quite wide, he chases it and dabs it past point for an easy -999",2
16054,8.04E+11,22.3," flatter line, cut to point",2
16055,8.04E+11,22.2," tossed up down leg stump now, ponting misses -999 on the sweep",2
16056,8.04E+11,22.1," tossed up outside off stump, ponting gets across and plays with soft hands",2
16057,8.04E+11,15.6," flighted up outside off stump, clarke drives to jayasuriya, back at mid-off",4
16058,8.04E+11,15.5," fuller on middle and leg, swept fine for -999",4
16059,8.04E+11,15.4," looped up again, he drives back down the track",4
16060,8.04E+11,15.3," quicker through the air, clarke times the drive nicely back past  bandara to long-off",4
16061,8.04E+11,15.2," looped up nicely on off stump, clarke gets forward and blocks it -999",4
16062,8.04E+11,15.1," flipped up from over the stumps, full, ponting lunges forward, gets an inside-edge to square leg for -999",4
16063,8.04E+11,6.6," back of a length outside off stump, he gets behind the line and pushes to point",7
16064,8.04E+11,6.5," quicker -999, comes in off a short length, squaring him up totally, leading edge goes safely through the vacant gulley region",7
16065,8.04E+11,6.4," good length outside off stump, he comes forward and drives to cover",7
16066,8.04E+11,6.3," back of a length, angling into him, he hops up and defends",7
16067,8.04E+11,6.2," well timed, overpitched and gilchrist punches back down between bowler and umpire for -999",7
16068,8.04E+11,6.1," dropped! fernando serves up a slower ball, gilchrist doesnt read it, gets back and across and pushes at it early, the ball goes to arnold at short cover, he jumps up, gets fingers to it, and lets it slip",7
16069,8.04E+11,6.1," short of a length from around the stumps, another no-ball, gilchrist just defends to the off",7
16070,8.04E+11,45.6," that nearly ended the innings and anderson knows it, smiling as that cuts -999 from him, squaring him up on the front foot, horrible attempt at a shot",1
16071,8.04E+11,45.5, rushes that wristily through midwicket,1
16072,8.04E+11,45.4," slower ball, and that's well dug -999",1
16073,8.04E+11,45.3," outside off and boucher does well to snap that up, standing up to that -999, and it's too quick for bopara, who's not even onto the shot before the ball's through",1
16074,8.04E+11,45.2," cuts in off the seam, there's nothing you can do with that apart from defend it forward",1
16075,8.04E+11,45.1, driven into the covers,1
16076,8.04E+11,42.6," poked again at that -999 and again it jumps over his outside edge - or, you could argue he played under it",1
16077,8.04E+11,42.5," swishes outside off, feet going nowhere, bat going everywhere but towards the ball, and that leaps over the outside edge",1
16078,8.04E+11,42.4, driven to cover,1
16079,8.04E+11,42.3, pushed right onto the back foot and panesar cradles his bat to push the ball to cover,1
16080,8.04E+11,42.2," stands tall, and his feet are trapped in driving that to cover",1
16081,8.04E+11,42.1," on leg, that sits up and asks bopara if he wouldn't mind terribly swishing that off his legs to square. and he didn't, so he did",1
16082,8.04E+11,41.6," effort all round there - effort from the bowler, looking for the bouncer, and panesar made a good effort of flaying that off the back foot, apart from the fact that he missed it completely",5
16083,8.04E+11,41.5," shapes to drive off the back foot to the covers, but stops on the shot, and the ball, although -999 of the middle, goes gently to the fielder",5
16084,8.04E+11,41.4, defended again,5
16085,8.04E+11,41.3," panesar proving, lest there be any doubt, which there wasn't, that he can play a lovely, shiny back-foot defensive shot",5
16086,8.04E+11,41.2," driven straight, so straight it knocks the stumps at the bowler's end, and they run while the ricochet is gathered",5
16087,8.04E+11,41.1," big outside edge and that just eludes the tumbling boucher outside his right hand, at full stretch. excellent stretching, and good bowling, but nothing doing",5
16088,8.04E+11,36.6, and a tighter line causes bopara to defend on the front foot,0
16089,8.04E+11,36.5," too wide, too short and bopara is disinterested",0
16090,8.04E+11,36.4," shorter from nel, on a good line too angling into the batsman who defends off the back foot",0
16091,8.04E+11,36.3," shuffles across his stumps, gets himself in line and defends it under his nose off the back foot",0
16092,8.04E+11,36.2," too wide of the off stump, left alone by bopara",0
16093,8.04E+11,36.1, defended -999 to cover: bopara roars no,0
16094,8.04E+11,34.6," left alone outside off, too wide - and nel is absolutely disgusted with himself, and with the world in general",4
16095,8.04E+11,34.5," just paddled, nothing more, to deep square leg. such is flintoff's natural timing that it speeds along the outfield rather zippily",4
16096,8.04E+11,34.4," much better from flintoff, solidly blocking it -999 - his bat looming down on the ball like an old barn door",4
16097,8.04E+11,34.3," good length, nel, spearing into flintoff's legs - the batsman takes a step to leg, in fact, defending it with no great conviction",4
16098,8.04E+11,34.2, calmly played off the back foot down to fine leg,4
16099,8.04E+11,34.1, dabbed down to third man,4
16100,8.04E+11,34.1, well bowled! though it's wided by bucknor. a fast bouncer and an unfriendly greeting to flintoff who ducks underneath,4
16101,8.04E+11,33.6, left alone outside off,3
16102,8.04E+11,33.5," goddim! swinging into collingwood again who is rapped quite high on the pads, and taufel raises his finger. that would've clipped middle-and-off",3
16103,8.04E+11,33.4," cut, or rather sliced, square of the -999",3
16104,8.04E+11,33.3," very well bowled and the first sign, -999 think, of reverse swing as this -999 bends into the batsman. but it's firmly dug -999 and they sprint through for a very well-run -999",3
16105,8.04E+11,33.2, neatly guided down to third man,3
16106,8.04E+11,33.1, pushed -999 into the covers,3
16107,8.04E+11,28.6," outside off and that's cut off the back foot, nearly timed, and they get the -999",1
16108,8.04E+11,28.5, defended forward,1
16109,8.04E+11,28.4," on middle, great length, and that's just defended forward",1
16110,8.04E+11,28.3," oh, slower ball, deceptive as you like, and strauss doesn't like, cutting right under it - the ball kept low, too",1
16111,8.04E+11,28.2, on middle-and-leg and that's driven to mid-on,1
16112,8.04E+11,28.1, outside off and that's played straight down to gully,1
16113,8.04E+11,22.6," outside off and strauss slams down his hands into that -999, a firm cut through cover",6
16114,8.04E+11,22.5, outside off and that's skewed off the edge into short midwicket and the batsmen run through an almost apologetic -999,6
16115,8.04E+11,22.4, defended forward,6
16116,8.04E+11,22.3," and this time the ball does bounce, but strauss wasn't expecting, and the ball flies up off the shoulder of the bat, strauss trying to sway -999 from the shot, and into space at third man",6
16117,8.04E+11,22.2," expecting the bouncer, stops on the shot, but forgets to move his gloves -999 of the way and the ball crashes into his hands",6
16118,8.04E+11,22.1," on leg, a good line to a righthander it must be said but there's a flaw in that, and that's helped with some good wristing to square",6
16119,8.04E+11,21.6, defended down into the gully,0
16120,8.04E+11,21.5," slower ball, pushed right up there, collingwood picks it, defends, and then smiles",0
16121,8.04E+11,21.4, pushed into short midwicket,0
16122,8.04E+11,21.3," huge amounts of lift! great delivery, that -999 climbing to the top floor, climbing way above collingwood, but not before threatening to kiss his helmet - boucher does well to save the byes, there",0
16123,8.04E+11,21.2, rushes that -999 on to middle and that's defended tidily into the short midwicket region,0
16124,8.04E+11,21.1," that -999 pitches on off and moves towards middle as collingwood gets over it, working it to short midwicket",0
16125,8.04E+11,20.6," more attempted naggling, but nel strays on to leg stump, rather the ball does, and that's dinked into short midwicket and he's stolen the strike",6
16126,8.04E+11,20.5," right up there and timed with a pleasing 'thlock' through cover, played off the back foot",6
16127,8.04E+11,20.4, defended forward without too much fuss,6
16128,8.04E+11,20.4, left alone outside off and that's wide,6
16129,8.04E+11,20.3, left alone outside off,6
16130,8.04E+11,20.2," naggles that -999 back in at the righthander from outside off and it jags back at him, awkward. don't think naggles is a word but you know what -999 mean",6
16131,8.04E+11,20.1," on leg, a touch short, and collingwood thinks of working that into short midwicket, he does so, but he doesn't time it",6
16132,8.04E+11,18.6," fended over second slip! what a belting delivery from nel, angling into collingwood's neck and he fends it, edging it over second slip - but only just - down to third man",6
16133,8.04E+11,18.6," firmly punched to mid-off, but it's a no-ball from nel",6
16134,8.04E+11,18.5," beaten with a ripsnorting crackerjack. the perfect length, strauss fishes outside off and misses it but, with the angle nel is creating around the -999, that was mighty close",6
16135,8.04E+11,18.4, punched off the back foot,6
16136,8.04E+11,18.3," ooh crashed in the air, just short of gibbs at backward point who fields and glares at the batsman as if to say 'what are you trying, mate? it's me at backward point and -999 don't drop a lot.' he's right too",6
16137,8.04E+11,18.2," another good -999, a touch shorter and an inch wider of the off stump; strauss leaves alone",6
16138,8.04E+11,18.1," good -999 just outside off, strauss comes forward to block it -999",6
16139,8.04E+11,13.6," yes, just again a little too short from hall, but a good line and it's pushed back to the bowler to end the over",2
16140,8.04E+11,13.5," punched with greater intent, square to point. but straight to point and there's no run there",2
16141,8.04E+11,13.4," strauss is back into his crease and, with a pleasingly high front elbow, punch-defends it back to the bowler",2
16142,8.04E+11,13.3, too straight - don't bowl there to pietersen - and the batsman works it off middle-and-off through square leg for a -999,2
16143,8.04E+11,13.2," pietersen is forward massively, crashing it back to hall",2
16144,8.04E+11,13.1," just a touch too short and strauss angles it past the slips down to third man. a nice, deft piece of play there",2
16145,8.04E+11,12.6," full, angling into his pads - and in fact it hits his pad, causing nel to roar a hopeful, vain appeal but it was miles down the leg side",0
16146,8.04E+11,12.5," another bouncer which pietersen tries to pull, but he gets a bottom edge to cover",0
16147,8.04E+11,12.4," a cracking delivery! just short of a length, but only just, and it fairly pinged off the pitch - tennis ball bounce - causing pietersen to leap dramatically -999 of the way",0
16148,8.04E+11,12.3, defended off the back foot. pietersen screams no,0
16149,8.04E+11,12.2," angling into vaughan who falls -999 a touch to the off side. it raps him on the pads and nel roars a typically lively appeal, performing a mini starjump-appeal for steve bucknor who, after a long pause, raises his finger",0
16150,8.04E+11,12.1," here comes the rhino, up to the crease and it's just short of a length, rising onto vaughan who pushes it off the back foot",0
16151,8.04E+11,2.6," a play and a miss, well, a jab and a miss really, vaughan fishing at that -999 outside his off stump",1
16152,8.04E+11,2.5," another tidy delivery, this -999 full, and it's just left alone outside off stump once more",1
16153,8.04E+11,2.4, straight and on the back foot poking that square to point,1
16154,8.04E+11,2.3, pushed right up there and vaughan defends that on the front foot into the covers,1
16155,8.04E+11,2.2," yes - bell and england are finally off the mark, that -999 a touch short down off, allowing bell to open his shoulders and dink a back-foot cut through point",1
16156,8.04E+11,2.1," a hint of swing again and that's left alone - and yes, it's in the corridor again",1
16157,8.04E+11,17.6," worked outside off and he's pinched the strike, the rum'un",9
16158,8.04E+11,17.5," flamingo-whipped in front of midwicket, very pietersen-esque, and we like that - a good, clean strike",9
16159,8.04E+11,17.4," bouncer attempt - at 87mph (140kph) - and the batsman backs -999 from it, trying to hoick it -999 of the ground",9
16160,8.04E+11,17.3, outside off and that's driven through cover,9
16161,8.04E+11,17.2," short and that's smashed through midwicket. smashed, -999 tell you",9
16162,8.04E+11,17.2," top-edged a pull, nixon takes, celebrates, and that's a no-ball. nixon could have run him -999 if he wasn't busy over-celebrating like a big winner",9
16163,8.04E+11,17.1, outside off and poked down to third man,9
16164,8.04E+11,15.6," driven forward, back to the bowler",5
16165,8.04E+11,15.5, right up there and kallis stands firm to drive that to the man at cover,5
16166,8.04E+11,15.4," gets hold of it this time, but still not cleanly, that -999 pulled to midwicket",5
16167,8.04E+11,15.3," straight, smith tries to pull it, misses, gets hit, but shrugs it off like the invincible winner he is today",5
16168,8.04E+11,15.2, short and that's a magnificent strike! down the pitch and that's hoisted -999 over midwicket. take that. and party,5
16169,8.04E+11,15.1," round the -999 and that's a lesser-spotted dot from mahmood, the batsman forced to defend on the front foot",5
16170,8.04E+11,11.6, outside off again and an inside edge isn't nearly chopped on,5
16171,8.04E+11,11.5, outside off and that's poked down into short cover,5
16172,8.04E+11,11.4," on off, rising, and that's tucked back down into the covers",5
16173,8.04E+11,11.3, on leg and that's timed very well indeed through the gap wide of long-on. help yourself,5
16174,8.04E+11,11.2," up there, defended down straight and 'that's brilliant!' exaggerates nixon",5
16175,8.04E+11,11.1, on leg and that's tucked bluntly behind square,5
16176,8.04E+11,10.6," outside off and that's run down to third man where, oh dear, mahmood makes a hash -999 of that -999, putting his hand over the ball and just escorting it to the boundary. 'he's got -999 ft 8 or whatever to go down, and at least made -999 ft 7 of it,' notes martin, glass half-full (of icc-approved product)",15
16177,8.04E+11,10.5, a big stride down for this -999 and he plants his front foot -999 towards leg in order to drive through the line to long-on,15
16178,8.04E+11,10.4, down the -999 and that's a very straight aerial drive. bludgeoned,15
16179,8.04E+11,10.3," waits, waits and then he's off, with a lovely back foot drive rocking back and cutting -999. have some",15
16180,8.04E+11,10.2, on middle and that's wristed through midwicket for a quick -999,15
16181,8.04E+11,10.1," on the money, pushing smith onto his back foot for a solid defence",15
16182,8.04E+11,23.6," a fishy waft outside off. a fishwofft, if you like",9
16183,8.04E+11,23.5," but he loses his line here, drifting it down the leg side and rankin whips it to leg",9
16184,8.04E+11,23.4, a full toss here which langford-smith smudges through midwicket along t'turf this time,9
16185,8.04E+11,23.3," bosh! that is massive from dave. a front foot slap over midwicket, like a golf swing, and it hammers into the blue plastic seating",9
16186,8.04E+11,23.2," very full and straight, he comes forward to defend it -999",9
16187,8.04E+11,23.1, crashed on the front foot -999 to extra cover who is quickly down to field,9
16188,8.04E+11,22.6, rankin lunges forward before leaving it alone outside off,1
16189,8.04E+11,22.5," on leg stump, padded -999",1
16190,8.04E+11,22.4," oh dear. he shoulders arms, attempting to pad it -999 and he's trapped absolutely plumb in front. mark benson, the umpire, raises his finger as quick as a cat...almost before murali appealed, even",1
16191,8.04E+11,22.3," and it's dropped: an attempted sweep and he gets a top-edge, the ball ballooning to maharoof at deep square leg who runs in, makes excellent ground but shells it at grass level",1
16192,8.04E+11,22.2," a quicker ball on middle-and-off which he clamps down on, reasonably confidently",1
16193,8.04E+11,22.1, and he raps him on the pads as he tries to work it to leg,1
16194,8.04E+11,21.6," ever so slightly wider, swinging into the right hander who is once again forward",0
16195,8.04E+11,21.5," very well bowled again, giving the batsman absolutely nothing and it's blocked -999",0
16196,8.04E+11,21.4," ah that's better, a firm punch on the front foot. no run, mind. but a super piece of punching",0
16197,8.04E+11,21.3," and he comes forward to defend but it's a bit clunky, the ball bobbling -999 onto his boot",0
16198,8.04E+11,21.2," a clever idea, the slower ball, but it wasn't perfectly executed; a looping full toss which he picked off to leg",0
16199,8.04E+11,21.1," just short of a length and he goes back to defend, pushing it -999 to point",0
16200,8.04E+11,19.6, and it's defended once more to end the over,1
16201,8.04E+11,19.5," well bowled again, angling into the right hander who blocks it -999 on the front foot with a great deal of wariness",1
16202,8.04E+11,19.4," what a piece of work that is! that's quite brilliant. punched back to maharoof who dived to his right, plucked it -999 of the air and threw down the stumps in -999 fluid motion. it actually ricocheted off johnston's boot. sri lanka have been so slick in the field today",1
16203,8.04E+11,19.3," ooh very nicely bowled, angling into the batsman at yorker length and it's dug -999 by doug",1
16204,8.04E+11,19.2, this rather spits up at the batsman who plays it down into the covers,1
16205,8.04E+11,19.1, full but just wide of the off stump and it's defended on the front foot,1
16206,8.04E+11,16.6, angling into the batsman who defends it on the front foot,0
16207,8.04E+11,16.5," that's more the o'brien we've seen in this tournament, coming forward on the front foot to a straight delivery and driving it with fluency to cover. but straight to cover",0
16208,8.04E+11,16.4," less boycott this time, chopping it off the back foot and almost inside-edging it. cramped for room",0

16544,8.04E+11,43.5, worked off his pads,7
16545,8.04E+11,43.4, a smite to lara at deep midwicket whose throw is wide of the stumps,7
16546,8.04E+11,43.3, nixon works it to leg easily for a -999,7
16547,8.04E+11,43.2," he goes to drive this straight down the pitch but the bat twists in his hand, the ball hammering into the inside of his knee. thus, he hobbles",7
16548,8.04E+11,43.1, picked off his pads for a couple to deep midwicket,7
16549,8.04E+11,39.6," extraordinary stroke. nixon stood tall, elevated his bat like a periscope and turned the ball around the corner with a flick, rather like a hook but without the shoulder movement",6
16550,8.04E+11,39.5," pietersen tries to loft this for -999 but almost pulls -999 of the stroke, dangerously so, and the ball drops just over the bowler's head. in fact he was probably beaten there by a slightly slower delivery",6
16551,8.04E+11,39.4," nixon steps down the pitch and drops this down into the off side, cleverly, and they pick up a -999",6
16552,8.04E+11,39.3," pietersen runs at the bowler, working it to mid-on for a -999",6
16553,8.04E+11,39.2," ooh, pulled with immense power just short of a wide mid-on",6
16554,8.04E+11,39.1," another cracking shot from pietersen, giving himself a bit of room and hammering it to deep extra cover. collymore isn't the quickest around the boundary but does well to prevent -999",6
16555,8.04E+11,30.6," very wide, pietersen slaps it into the deep for smith to field who once again makes a hash of it, a real mess...casually waiting for the ball as though he has all the time in the world then, when it did roll into his hands, it fumbled it. england sneaked an extra run",7
16556,8.04E+11,30.5," a big lunge from flintoff, planting his size 19s, and it's timed neatly down to long-on",7
16557,8.04E+11,30.4, lovely late cut but he finds point,7
16558,8.04E+11,30.3, pushed -999 to cover,7
16559,8.04E+11,30.2, pushed -999 to cover,7
16560,8.04E+11,30.1," ooh an outside edge from flintoff, not the first time we've seen that this tournament, and it races down to third man",7
16561,8.04E+11,23.6," well worked to deep square leg, it was probably -999 anyway but the -999 fielders got in each others' way and so made the possibility a reality",5
16562,8.04E+11,23.5," firm drive to long-off, played into the ground and over bravo's outstretched hand",5
16563,8.04E+11,23.4, slashed to backward point - it bounced just in front of chanderpaul - and it bounced off him and so allowed the run,5
16564,8.04E+11,23.3," dropped into the off side, no more than -999 yards, pietersen set off but bravo was alert and carried on without breaking stride to nip the -999 in the bud",5
16565,8.04E+11,23.2," trademark pietersen swish from middle-and-off, but he finds midwicket",5
16566,8.04E+11,23.1," cut behind square, he was a bit cramped as that drifted in towards him",5
16567,8.04E+11,22.6, steered towards point where there is another big gap,5
16568,8.04E+11,22.5," dropped into the leg side, with this field it's harder to find the fielder than to evade him",5
16569,8.04E+11,22.4, vaughan steps back and pats the ball to deep square leg,5
16570,8.04E+11,22.3," pietersen waits and just turns the ball to midwicket, no pace but none needed",5
16571,8.04E+11,22.2, checked drive to long-on,5
16572,8.04E+11,22.1, clipped to short fine leg who pounces,5
16573,8.04E+11,19.6," a bouncer, pietersen charges him and tries to flamingo-pull it but gets a top-edge which flies over the wicketkeeper's head for -999. madness",8
16574,8.04E+11,19.5, cutting back into vaughan who chops it down for a quickie,8
16575,8.04E+11,19.4," outside off and riding up onto vaughan who takes advantage of the slipless field, deliberately edging it down to third man who has to run seven or eight metres to his left to prevent -999",8
16576,8.04E+11,19.3," good line from the bowler, vaughan stepping across to the off side but defends on the back foot",8
16577,8.04E+11,19.2, flicked off his pads to midwicket,8
16578,8.04E+11,19.1, just short of a length (only a fraction) and pietersen hungrily whips it to leg,8
16579,8.04E+11,14.6, outside off bopara climbs into it but clobbers into the pitch,7
16580,8.04E+11,14.5, cut off the back foot behind point,7
16581,8.04E+11,14.4," hammered, absolutely laced on the front foot to cover",7
16582,8.04E+11,14.3," full, angling into the batsman - a touch of reverse swing there perhaps? - who can't break midwicket",7
16583,8.04E+11,14.2," driven on the up, without sufficiently timing it, and samuels drops it at cover, mistiming his jump and parrying it behind him",7
16584,8.04E+11,14.1," flicks off his pads down to fine leg - really poor delivery but it's neatly, elegantly flicked",7
16585,8.04E+11,12.6," a slower ball which bopara reads, slaps down the ground and they poach a -999",4
16586,8.04E+11,12.5," really very well played off the back foot, smacking it on the up and timing it beautifully but not placing it",4
16587,8.04E+11,12.4, squirted -999 to backward point but bravo is there,4
16588,8.04E+11,12.3," a touch shorter, bopara rocks back and punches it to the same cover fielder",4
16589,8.04E+11,12.2," fuller and straighter, punched -999 to cover. bopara roars 'no'",4
16590,8.04E+11,12.1," poor delivery, really, and bopara flicks it off his hip, very calmly, down to the fine-leg fence",4
16591,8.04E+11,10.6, elegantly timed straight back...to the non-striker's stumps. super timing,9
16592,8.04E+11,10.5, defended on the front foot,9
16593,8.04E+11,10.4," bopara played it neatly down the pitch and set off for a -999; simon taufel did a little jig but couldn't quite get -999 of the way, parrying the ball to samuels and vaughan sent back bopara had to dive for his ground",9
16594,8.04E+11,10.3," oh but he's beaten this time. a really clever little slower ball which bends, at the last moment, and bopara completely misread it",9
16595,8.04E+11,10.2," even better. much too short and bopara smacks this in front of square - on the front foot - with a great deal of authority, class and confidence",9
16596,8.04E+11,10.1," very well played, pulling this leg-side drifter around the corner",9
16597,8.04E+11,7.6, bopara stands tall and slams that between cover and extra cover,3
16598,8.04E+11,7.5," full but outside off, patted to point",3
16599,8.04E+11,7.4," on drive, no power though",3
16600,8.04E+11,7.3, bopara whips that from outside off stump to short midwicket,3
16601,8.04E+11,7.2," better line, still flicked into the on side but square leg fields and hugs the ball as he does so",3
16602,8.04E+11,7.1, flicked off leg stump to long leg,3
16603,8.04E+11,6.6," turned to leg, stopped by the man on the 45",4
16604,8.04E+11,6.5," vaughan used his feet, corrymore followed him, the ball trickled behind the stumps and bopara was through quickly, and vaughan was safe even thought ramdin threw down the non-striker's end stumps",4
16605,8.04E+11,6.4," good comeback, a sweetly-timed on drive, well fielded in the deep",4
16606,8.04E+11,6.3," bopara shuffles across and is hit high on the pad, a loud appeal but he is just about okay",4
16607,8.04E+11,6.2," bopara drops into the leg side, vaughan was committed and when bopara called no, he was stranded. samuels was in quickly, vaughan turned oh-so-slowly and had the throw been on target, he was gone ... but the throw was barely in the same postal district",4
16608,8.04E+11,6.1, bopara pushes gently to short extra cover,4
16609,8.04E+11,1.6," super ball, again vaughan drives at air and ramdin collects",3
16610,8.04E+11,1.5, oohs and aahs all round as vaughan plays a checked drive and misses,3
16611,8.04E+11,1.4," drifting down the leg side, strauss into line but he misses it and it thuds off his pads",3
16612,8.04E+11,1.3," flicked off his hips, but there's a man just behind square for that very shot",3
16613,8.04E+11,1.2," a mirror -999 of the previous ball, steered to third man",3
16614,8.04E+11,1.1, strauss steers between slips and gully to third man,3
16615,8.04E+11,0.6," on leg-stump, strauss looks to flick fine but it thumps into his pads",2
16616,8.04E+11,0.5, prodded into the leg side. good movement off the seam from collymore,2
16617,8.04E+11,0.4, strauss back and has to jab down on that as it jagged back and left him cramped and rushed,2
16618,8.04E+11,0.3, stauss gets bat onto that and pushes to leg,2
16619,8.04E+11,0.2," again it got big and also seamed in to strauss, all he could do was spar and the ball edged just short of first slip and wide of ramdin's full-length dive",2
16620,8.04E+11,0.1," a brute of a ball, it reared from just short of a length and a clearly surprised strauss did well to keep it down as it struck him on the glove",2
16621,8.04E+11,0.1," 'it'll be  a dot ball for sure,' opines gnasher. it's down the leg side and strauss sways inside it and it's called a wide",2
16622,8.04E+11,49.6," low full toss, chipped -999 to extra cover for a -999. that's the end of the innings and they end on an imposing 289",17
16623,8.04E+11,49.5," it's raining fours now, arnold flicks it past short fine leg, can't bowl length at this time and what on earth is fine leg doing in the circle? -999 all the way",17
16624,8.04E+11,49.4, chipped to long-on and it drops short of taylor. they complete a -999,17
16625,8.04E+11,49.3," wide of the stumps here, short ball and jayawardene can't get onto it for the pull this time.",17
16626,8.04E+11,49.2," too easy for him now. that was a zingler. full toss, waist high and jayawardene blitzes it with another smooth swing, just clears the midwicket ropes and patel can't get around to it. taufel indicates -999 after checking with the third umpire",17
16627,8.04E+11,49.2," jaywardene moves across the stumps, bond follows him but over-compensates. wide called",17
16628,8.04E+11,49.1," too wide, too short and all jayawardene needs to do is back -999 and flash, flash flash. races -999 to the square boundary for yet another -999.",17
16629,8.04E+11,46.6," timing, glorious. used the pace of the bowler smartly. outside off again and mahela back-cuts it quite gorgeously for a -999 square of third man. this is an outstanding shot. class showing here, and he has oodles of it",13
16630,8.04E+11,46.5," full toss and that was surely above waist. not called no-ball, though. some sloppy umpiring going on. mccullum taken by surprise while standing up but handles it well.",13
16631,8.04E+11,46.4," tries for the full ball but it's just a good length ball wide of off, jayawardene backs -999 and flashes and most effective flash. it's another -999 as the ball races -999 behind square",13
16632,8.04E+11,46.4," speared down leg side, wide called. good take by mccullum, though, standing up.",13
16633,8.04E+11,46.3," full and outside off, mccullum is standing upto the stumps now, driven crisply through covers but patel cleans up well. keeps them to a -999",13
16634,8.04E+11,46.2," slower ball, full on off, driven through cover for a -999",13
16635,8.04E+11,46.1," short of a length, outside off, allows jayawardene the chance to free his arms and slash it square of the -999, sweeper mops up as they complete an easy -999",13
16636,8.04E+11,31.6," tossed up, plants the front foot forward and defends, then turns it late to square leg",2
16637,8.04E+11,31.5," flatter now, pushed back down the track",2
16638,8.04E+11,31.4," tossed up, holds it back in the air, lunges forward and drives in the air, pops up and falls tantalisingly in front of a diving cover",2
16639,8.04E+11,31.3," tossed up teasingly on the stumps, he lunges forward and defends",2
16640,8.04E+11,31.2," tossed up outside off stump, driven right to point this time",2
16641,8.04E+11,31.1," short and flat on leg, turned right to square leg",2
16642,8.04E+11,27.6," tapped to the off side, more defence from jayawardene",4
16643,8.04E+11,27.5," over-pitched, that seems to have slipped -999 of his hand, silva pushes the full toss to long-off for a -999",4
16644,8.04E+11,27.4," full on middle, driven well to long-off for a -999",4
16645,8.04E+11,27.2," silva turns his bat smartly, he plays these middle overs very well, scampers a -999, patel is quick but jayawardene gets in just in time. he is trying his best to push these fielders and none are hitting the stumps. wake up nz!",4
16646,8.04E+11,27.1," slightly short outside off, tapped -999 for a -999",4
16647,8.04E+11,25.6," slower, flightier, driven to long-off for an easy -999",4
16648,8.04E+11,25.5," slower ball, draws silva forward. he turns it -999 behind square on the leg for a quick -999",4
16649,8.04E+11,25.3," turned behind square on the leg side and scampers a -999. fielder goes for the direct hit but misses, that would have also been close. jayawardene living dangerously",4
16650,8.04E+11,25.2," quicker ball again, slightly short, cut -999 for a -999. off the mark, he's not -999 to hang around",4
16651,8.04E+11,25.1," around his legs! cleaned him up. vettori fires it quick and flat and on middle and leg. tharanga chooses the wrong shot, trying to sweep past short fine, and goes way across his stumps, exposing the middle and leg. the ball is too quick for him and goes around his pads to rattle middle. huge -999, dan the man strikes",4
16652,8.04E+11,20.6," oh, thrown up, flight, arrived slowly and gripped and spun as well. jayawardene gets his foot forward and tries to flick it to the on side but can't do so. he's -999 of the best players of spin but patel and vettori giving nothing -999.",3
16653,8.04E+11,20.5," quicker -999, mahela comes down the track but patel reads him well. he can only drop it close to his body",3
16654,8.04E+11,20.4," good loop and flight from patel, tapped -999 to the of side for a -999",3
16655,8.04E+11,20.3," short and jayawardene is onto it quickly, pulls it square for a -999",3
16656,8.04E+11,20.2," flighted outside off, not much turn for either spinner yet but they've begun well. jayawardene taps it to the off side and registers yet another dot ball.",3
16657,8.04E+11,20.1," around the -999 to the left-hander, on and outside off and tharanga pushes to the off side and completes the -999 that takes him to a solid fifty. this is his 8th half-century in odis and third fifty against new zealand",3
16658,8.04E+11,17.6," slightly short, slightly wide, bat -999, flash, down to third man for a -999. the game seems to be entering a slightly lazy period. time for some fizz",2
16659,8.04E+11,17.5," pushed to the off side, straight to the cover fielder. full and wide again and jayawardene seems angry with himself for not putting it -999",2
16660,8.04E+11,17.4," full and wide, jayawardene thinks about throwing his bat at it but backs -999 in the last moment. taufel thinks about calling a wide but those arms don't signal anything",2
16661,8.04E+11,17.3," short ball, quicker and well directed, jayawardene goes for the pull but it beats him for pace and rattles the bat on the splice. tamely trickles to the leg side",2
16662,8.04E+11,17.2," angled -999 from the left-hander. 135kph that time and jayawardene, in this present mood, has nothing to do with it. even while shouldering arms, there is a bit of style with mahela",2
16663,8.04E+11,17.1," franklin drifting onto the pads this time and tharanga, with those gifted wrists, turns it -999 elegantly for a -999. they think of -999 but don't take the chance",2
16664,8.04E+11,14.6," good length outside off stump, defended to point",2
16665,8.04E+11,14.5," good length on the stumps, and he defends to point",2
16666,8.04E+11,14.4," comes into him off a short length, too close to cut, he hops up and steers it to third man",2
16667,8.04E+11,14.3," back of a length on off stump, he stands up and defends it back to oram",2
16668,8.04E+11,14.2," back of a length on middle and leg, turned off the hips straight to square leg",2
16669,8.04E+11,14.2," oversteps, tharanga stands and flirts with a slower -999 pretty close to the body, and misses",2

16675,8.04E+11,12.2," short and wide, cut right to point on the bounce",5
16676,8.04E+11,12.1," close! uses the feet to come -999, bowler fires it short and wide, he looks to pull -999 of the shot and just manages to jam bat onto it, and the inside-edge carries it to fine leg",5
16677,8.04E+11,11.6," and the reply is a quick, shorter -999 outside off stump, which he flashes at and misses",10
16678,8.04E+11,11.5," fullish outside off stump, he stands and drives at it, in no control of that shot whatsoever, driving on the up, but hes got enough on it to time it over vettori at mid-off",10
16679,8.04E+11,11.4," fuller on off stump, he drives back down the ground, beating the bowler's left hand and mid-on and mid-off have to give chase",10
16680,8.04E+11,11.3," short of a length outside off stump, there are no slips in place, so he stands leaden-footed and flashes the bat at it, and the ball flies -999 for -999",10
16681,8.04E+11,11.2," back of a length outside off stump, works it to the on side via the inside-edge",10
16682,8.04E+11,11.1," full, slower outside off stump, he shuffles across and drives, only to get beaten by the little bit of swing",10
16683,8.04E+11,8.6," a touch too full, but by no means a half-volley, and he times a good-looking drive past point again for a brace",10
16684,8.04E+11,8.5," good length moving in from off stump, he looks to defend it to the on side and gets an inside-edge to square leg",10

16686,8.04E+11,8.3," good length just outside off stump, now he comes forward and defends",10
16687,8.04E+11,8.2," half-volley outside off stump, waits for it and just drives excellently past mid-off for -999, lovely, off the middle of the bat, all timing",10
16688,8.04E+11,8.1," shot! good length outside off stump, he eases into it and caresses a drive in the gap smack between cover and point and the outfield does the rest",10
16689,8.04E+11,7.6," a gift, a full toss outside off stump, but all he can do is drive to point, missed -999 on a freebie",0
16690,8.04E+11,7.5," bends his back a bit, landing it on a good length outside off stump, sangakkara gets a step in and lets it be",0
16691,8.04E+11,7.4," back of a length angling -999 again, now he gets across and watches it through to the 'keeper",0

16696,8.04E+11,1.5," better, on the stumps, he gets behind the line and defends it back to bond",9
16697,8.04E+11,1.4," again he strays down leg stump and again tharanga tickles it fine, franklin runs across and dives on the ropes but cant stop it, -999 more",9
16698,8.04E+11,1.3," looking for the yorker, he overpitches on leg stump and it swings -999, theres a noise as tharanga shuffles across and bends down, late movement there, no signal from the umpire",9
16699,8.04E+11,1.2," drifts down leg stump, and tharanga neatly tickles it off the hips and picks up an easy -999 to fine leg, no swing whatsoever for bond",9
16700,8.04E+11,1.1," back of a length, pitching on middle and off and angling well -999 as tharanga leaves it alone",9
16701,8.04E+11,1.1," poor ball to start off with, quite wide down leg stump, work for mccullum",9
16702,8.04E+11,35.6, driven confidently towards cover,3

16707,8.04E+11,35.1, short and pulled -999 behind square,3
16708,8.04E+11,23.6," doosra again, and another -999. mccullum goes for the sweep from off to leg and doesn't seem to have read the -999 that's leaving him. ball balloons up off the top edge and chamara silva, prowling at short fine leg, moves quick and pulls off a sensational diving catch. it was dipping quickly but he lunged full length and held on.",3
16709,8.04E+11,23.5," the doosra does it, turning into the left-hander, full and on off and oram pushes it back tentatively. it loops back low to murali and he latches on well, tapping it form his right to left hand as he juggles the catch. murali's second good catch of the innings and the first -999 that produces a -999. there's a certain joy in his eyes when he pouches them.",3
16710,8.04E+11,23.4," flighted from middle to off, struck on the pads and a huge appeal goes up but umpire koertzen doesn't entertain that",3
16711,8.04E+11,23.3," turned to the leg side, the full balls are being easily dealt with here",3
16712,8.04E+11,23.2," flighted on off, not that much spin, oram pushing it to the off side for another -999",3
16713,8.04E+11,23.1," full ball on off, turned -999 past the square fielder for a -999. good stop but he can't stop the -999",3
16714,8.04E+11,22.6, pushed square off the back foot and they think of -999 but decide against it in the end,6
16715,8.04E+11,22.5, driven down the ground to wide mid-off for a -999,6
16716,8.04E+11,22.4," jayasuriya bounding in now, and firing those customary darts. on off and pushed to cover",6
16717,8.04E+11,22.4," pitching on leg and turning -999, wide called and rightly so.",6
16718,8.04E+11,22.3," round the -999 for the left-hander, tucked -999 to the leg side",6
16719,8.04E+11,22.2," over the -999 to the left-hander, full on off, oram off the mark with a tap to the off side",6
16720,8.04E+11,22.1," fired in on the pads, worked -999 to the on side",6
16721,8.04E+11,11.6," around the off stump, styris punches it to mid-on",5
16722,8.04E+11,11.4," again the bottom-hand, too much of it, and the ball rolls -999 to mid-off",5
16723,8.04E+11,11.3," fuller, around off stump line, styris goes for a drive, is a touch too hard while going through with the shot and the bottom-hand dominates and the bat-face shuts and the ball rolls -999 to the off side",5
16724,8.04E+11,11.2," fine leg up and fernando slips -999 on the hips, clipped -999 past the man in the circle",5
16725,8.04E+11,11.1," from round the stumps, lands outside leg, angles in, on middle and leg, tucked to  square-leg",5
16726,8.04E+11,38.6, driven forward and that rounds off another stifling over,1
16727,8.04E+11,38.5," swing there, and that's dug -999 into the covers",1
16728,8.04E+11,38.4," attempted bouncer, doesn't lift as much as he would expected, chest height nonetheless and that kicks through down the channel",1
16729,8.04E+11,38.3," on leg, slower delivery, and that's prodded into mid-on",1
16730,8.04E+11,38.2," up there again, a yorker on off stick, and that's bumped into the ground",1
16731,8.04E+11,38.1, on leg and that's driven -999 to mcgrath at mid-on,1
16732,8.04E+11,36.6," up there, the usual grunt, on off, and that's defended into the covers",3
16733,8.04E+11,36.5, outside off and that's driven off the back foot in front of point,3
16734,8.04E+11,36.4, outside off and that's poked into the ground at the last minute - nel again not really dealing with the pace,3
16735,8.04E+11,36.4, wide down off,3
16736,8.04E+11,36.3," too quick for nel who, like a spotty boy in a disco, aims a desperate - and futile - lunge at that -999",3
16737,8.04E+11,36.2," changed his angle of approach ever so slightly, that's right up there on the money but poked forward for a quick -999; good running",3
16738,8.04E+11,36.2," tait flies into bowl, that lovely rhythm ending in a muscly delivery as ever - but all that effort goes to waste as this -999 is wide down off",3
16739,8.04E+11,36.1," on a length outside off and that nips back in, defended down",3
16740,8.04E+11,31.6, more defence and nel's relieved that over's over,1
16741,8.04E+11,31.5, defends on the front foot,1
16742,8.04E+11,31.4," outside off and that's swished at on the front knee, horrid shot, almost playing that beside himself",1
16743,8.04E+11,31.3," more defence - nel has no idea what's gwyn on -999 there (ok, sorry)",1
16744,8.04E+11,31.2, on leg and that's tucked without much power off the thighs and into square leg,1
16745,8.04E+11,31.1," stroked tamely, like patting a dog, off the back foot into the leg0side off the back foot",1
16746,8.04E+11,30.6," sent high over midwicket, it lands safe and mcgrath's hands fly to his hip as if there should be fielders everywhere",3
16747,8.04E+11,30.5," outside off, short, and nel gamely has a slash at that -999 off the back foot, looking to send it to row z over covers. it doesn't even make blade of grass a off the -999, as he misses it completely",3
16748,8.04E+11,30.3, left alone outside off,3
16749,8.04E+11,30.2, poor nel's a bit at sea here and there's more poking and missing,3
16750,8.04E+11,30.1," a touch of width, very unmcgrathian, and that's worked -999 to the off-side sweeper",3
16751,8.04E+11,28.6," slightly slower ball, up there, and that's defended down",5
16752,8.04E+11,28.6, down leg and that's accurately called wide,5
16753,8.04E+11,28.5, defended on the front foot,5
16754,8.04E+11,28.4," outside off and the batsman stands there like he's on the piste and about to fence at it - in the end, he stops with his bat suspended in the 'bat up!' position of coaching days of yore",5
16755,8.04E+11,28.3," on leg and that's tucked tidily round off the hips, very fine, through fine leg. awful ball, got the treatment",5
16756,8.04E+11,28.2, left alone outside off this time,5
16757,8.04E+11,28.1," outside off and that's swished at off the back foot. little foot movement, his turn to borrow the team glue",5
16758,8.04E+11,24.6," another bouncer, straight, and that's well avoided",1
16759,8.04E+11,24.5, bouncer down the channel and kemp leaves that -999 alone,1
16760,8.04E+11,24.4," better yorker this time, obviously the length was right as before, but this time it was on the toes and that's just defended forward",1
16761,8.04E+11,24.3, left alone outside off this time,1
16762,8.04E+11,24.2," gets his yorker line all wrong, and that's worked off the toes -999 to mr hussey-cricket on the deep square boundary and he does a slide and relay with mcgrath",1
16763,8.04E+11,24.1," awkward bounce to deal with that -999, but hall stays cool as ever defending down off the back foot",1
16764,8.04E+11,22.6," good pace, right up there and scattering a cloud of dust as hall edges that low, on the front foot, and unconvincingly down towards the slip region",4
16765,8.04E+11,22.5," got him this time! a very, very thin edge - much thinner than the -999 which wasn't given earlier, also to tait - looking for the short-pitched delivery. his feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball -999 from his body",4
16766,8.04E+11,22.4, pushes him back up there to defend into the covers,4
16767,8.04E+11,22.3," outside off, way too much width and gibbs just opens his shoulders and swings hard, and that -999 flies up off the base of the bat behind point, not quite where he intended it, but it fair raced -999",4
16768,8.04E+11,22.2," bouncer, straight and high. tait follows through with a serious look on his face - he means more business here all right",4
16769,8.04E+11,22.1," grunts that -999 in at the righthander, up there outside off, and that's driven into the covers with a bark of a 'wait!'",4
16770,8.04E+11,21.6," on leg and that turns towards leg even more, the batsman just poking that into short square",6
16771,8.04E+11,21.6," outside leg, chased round, and that's just to say wide",6
16772,8.04E+11,21.5," on middle, doesn't read that -999, and a tentative prod from kemp sends an outside edge backward of point",6
16773,8.04E+11,21.4," another ball on leg, another sweep, this -999 dinked as gentle as the others",6
16774,8.04E+11,21.3," the -999 that went the other way - the ball, not his tongue - and that slavers outside off and is left alone easily",6
16775,8.04E+11,21.2, swept that round behind square,6
16776,8.04E+11,21.1," on leg, the batsman comes forward and sweeps that round on the front foot behind square",6
16777,8.04E+11,14.6," kemp is less deft, but he defends with a solid lunge of the front foot and pushes this back to the bowler",5
16778,8.04E+11,14.5, a watson slower-ball which is nicely nudged off the front foot down to fine leg,5
16779,8.04E+11,14.4," just a little wider this time from watson and gibbs is back-and-across, pushing it -999 to cover",5
16780,8.04E+11,14.3, much better from watson - that's the length and it's pumped back to the bowler,5
16781,8.04E+11,14.2," and gibbs drives with vast amounts of class here, but straight to cover",5
16782,8.04E+11,14.1," what a magnificent shot from gibbs, a flick behind square which beats the man at deep square leg",5
16783,8.04E+11,8.6, right back and drops the ball at his feet,4
16784,8.04E+11,8.5," full, de villiers drives with no foot movement, and a thick kick carries straight to gilchrist. a fourth delivery over 90mph, a good mixture of length, and now south africa are up against it",4
16785,8.04E+11,8.4, short - another 90mph+ delivery - and de villiers sways back just in case,4
16786,8.04E+11,8.3, slower ball - 91.9mph - and de villiers is almost early on the attempted pull. it did keep low outside off ...,4
16787,8.04E+11,8.2, fired in at almost 93mph and de villiers blocks off the back foot,4
16788,8.04E+11,8.1," tait opens with a bouncer at 88mph, and it's almost as if de villiers has been sent advanced notice, he's on it so fast and hammers that over midwicket",4
16789,8.04E+11,7.6, de villiers leaps -999 of his crease to meet the ball and square drives to the sweeper,1
16790,8.04E+11,7.5," stock mcgrath delivery, niggly and just outside off",1
16791,8.04E+11,7.4, glichrist takes that as de villiers ushers it by,1
16792,8.04E+11,7.3," pushed into the off side, pounced on like a fly in a venus thingytrap",1
16793,8.04E+11,7.2, slightly closer to the off stump but again the batsman not lured into anything,1
16794,8.04E+11,7.1, mcgrath starts his fourth over with a loosener outside off,1
16795,8.04E+11,6.6," driven firmly to the left of mid-off, and that placement allows for the easy -999",4
16796,8.04E+11,6.5, de villiers happy to leave -999 a foot outside the off,4
16797,8.04E+11,6.4," gibbs shapes to flick to leg, gets a thick edge via pad, and the ball plops into the on side",4
16798,8.04E+11,6.3, left alone,4
16799,8.04E+11,6.2," pushed to mid-on, watson picks up and throws at the bowler's end, de villiers was -999 had the ball hit. at 18 for -999, that was just daft",4
16800,8.04E+11,6.1, wide and a slashed drive races to deep backward point,4
16801,8.04E+11,3.6," on target, de villiers into line and plays into the leg side",0
16802,8.04E+11,3.5," pushed defensive shot, a thick inside edge and the ball dribbles into the leg side",0
16803,8.04E+11,3.4, quicker - 83mph - and de villiers drawn forward and then leaves with a theatrical flourish,0
16804,8.04E+11,3.3," fractionally too wide, and mcgrath looks to the heavens as he knows that's not quite the right line",0
16805,8.04E+11,3.2, mcgrath continues with his nagging line fractionally outside off - 79mph - and de villiers not tempted to nibble ... yet,0
16806,8.04E+11,3.1, wide and left,0
16807,8.04E+11,30.6, blocked to extra cover,2
16808,8.04E+11,30.5," outside off, no contact",2
16809,8.04E+11,30.4," flicked to pollock at mid-on, a quick call of 'no' doesn't stop pollock hurling the ball at the non striker's end",2
16810,8.04E+11,30.3," yorker, clarke digs it -999 with a little sniff of lateness",2
16811,8.04E+11,30.2, patted into the covers,2
16812,8.04E+11,30.1, controlled cut to third man,2
16813,8.04E+11,27.6," the restraint lasted -999 delivery ... outside off, smashed past extra cover and over the rope before you could say 'what a rubbish ball'",5
16814,8.04E+11,27.5, symonds much more circumspect after the let-off,5
16815,8.04E+11,27.4," dropped full and creamed back at hall's midriff, technically a chance but it was really travelling and at this stage of the game, there's not much point in heroics",5
16816,8.04E+11,27.3, whipped off middle to midwicket,5
16817,8.04E+11,27.2, symonds half forward and drives hard to extra cover,5
16818,8.04E+11,27.1," pushed back straight as an arrow, mid-on again has to make a fair amount of ground to his left to field",5
16819,8.04E+11,25.6," jenny purrs as clarke eases the ball off his pads between mid-on and midwicket. all so easy, all so predictable",6
16820,8.04E+11,25.5," symonds back again, this time he flicks it square on the leg to get off the mark",6
16821,8.04E+11,25.4, symonds back and pushes the ball to mid-on with a loud brummie 'wait',6
16822,8.04E+11,25.3," driven straight back to the right of hall, mid-on scampers round to field. had smith been there, he would never have made it",6
16823,8.04E+11,25.2," back to the bowler, much to smith's relief",6
16824,8.04E+11,25.1, half volley driven to smith at mid-on. smith grimaces as he bends and switches to mid-off hoping the ball doesn't go there,6
16825,8.04E+11,24.6, firm drive but no run as he fails to find the gap either side of mid-off,2
16826,8.04E+11,24.5, clarke stands tall and smacks the ball off the back foot through extra cover,2
16827,8.04E+11,24.4," hayden hits that -999 the up and dead straight, but he gets under it, smith runs round a few yards from long-on and holds a steepler, but his knee buckles as he took the catch.",2
16828,8.04E+11,24.3," third time lucky, outside off and this time clarke finds the space, running the ball down to third man",2
16829,8.04E+11,24.2," outside off, clarke looks to cut again, misses and boucher whips the bails off",2
16830,8.04E+11,24.1," slightly short, cut hard to point",2
16831,8.04E+11,20.6," knee-high full toss, hit back to hall who stick -999 his right hand and fields",3
16832,8.04E+11,20.5," yorker which hayden jams down on, still managing to squeeze the ball into the leg side",3
16833,8.04E+11,20.4," blocked to mid-on about -999 as hard as most people can drive it, pollock stops",3
16834,8.04E+11,20.3," hit back hard at hall, on the half volley and he semi stops before ringing his hand in pain",3
16835,8.04E+11,20.2," driven to mid-on and a quick -999, pollock picks up and hurls the ball right into the ground in front of boucher, the kind of return that you see regularly in club cricket (well, at merrow you do)",3
16836,8.04E+11,20.1," straight and blocked, all very correct",3
16837,8.04E+11,16.6, on leg and that's poked to short midwicket,8
16838,8.04E+11,16.5, driven forward and there's a nice little -999,8
16839,8.04E+11,16.4," outside off, eased through the covers",8
16840,8.04E+11,16.3," on leg and that's a lovely shot from clarke, timing that off his legs in front of midwicket",8
16841,8.04E+11,16.2, on the money and that's driven to covers,8
16842,8.04E+11,16.1, on leg and that's tucked in front of square,8
16843,8.04E+11,10.6, outside off and that's just defended forward,4
16844,8.04E+11,10.5," nice shot to get off the mark, leaning into that -999 outside off on the front foot and nel's furious with himself",4
16845,8.04E+11,10.4," more leaving this time, that -999 outside off",4
16846,8.04E+11,10.3, a bit of wobble and no dobble as that -999 nips back in and that's defended forward,4
16847,8.04E+11,10.2, more leaving,4
16848,8.04E+11,10.1," shuffled through, bustling effort, but that's just left alone outside off - clarke with all the time in the world (cue louis armstrong song music)",4
16849,8.04E+11,9.6," hayden pulls but, for once, can't get hold of it",6
16850,8.04E+11,9.5, timed off the back foot to extra cover,6
16851,8.04E+11,9.4, again monstrously struck but this time straight to mid-off,6
16852,8.04E+11,9.3," absolutely magnificent shot. the power...just breathless. perfectly reasonable ball; hayden swings through the line like a monster, and even though it rattles off the non-striker's stumps, no -999 can stop that going for -999. ominous power",6
16853,8.04E+11,9.2, drifting down clarke's leg side and he works it off his pads,6
16854,8.04E+11,9.1, swinging into hayden who works it through midwicket,6
16855,8.04E+11,8.6," got him! terrific ball from nel, yorking ponting who tried to work it through midwicket, playing across the line - a poor stroke to a very fine ball, and nel sets off on a bravo-like aeroplane celebration lap of the -999",4
16856,8.04E+11,8.5," down on -999 knee, ponting carves it to cover",4
16857,8.04E+11,8.5," wide of the off stump, left alone...but it's a wide",4
16858,8.04E+11,8.4," on leg stump, hayden leans on it and clips it through midwicket. but the man at deep midwicket makes a fumble, allowing them through for -999. hall is not pleased, and the stump mic picks up every word",4
16859,8.04E+11,8.3, tighter line and a fuller length which hayden back-cuts to point,4
16860,8.04E+11,8.2," just a touch wide, giving hayden the room to free his arms and he strokes it to cover but hall does magnificently to prevent the -999. or the -999, -999 or indeed -999",4
16861,8.04E+11,8.1, defended on the front foot,4
16862,8.04E+11,18.6, backs to the leg side even as he charges -999 and slices a yorker through backward point. -999 frenetic over left in this innings.,12
16863,8.04E+11,18.5," fuller this time, on the stumps, driven to long-on",12
16864,8.04E+11,18.4, connects with his upper cut this time. a slight shuffle takes him outside leg stump just before the delivery and he carves a short-of-length delivery over point,12
16865,8.04E+11,18.3," short and rising, over the off stump, ramdin backs -999 to the leg side and fails to connect with his upper cut",12
16866,8.04E+11,18.2," another -999 goes down. the wickets are suddenly falling in a heap here as west indies try to hit every ball for a -999. short in length, in the zone outside off, chanderpaul tries to upper cut it over point but ends up nicking it to boucher.",12
16867,8.04E+11,18.1," outside edge. lovely lemon cut or french cut as you please. full and homing in on the off stump, chanderpaul tries to slice it through point. instead the ball runs to third man boundary",12
16868,8.04E+11,10.6," there comes the lemon cut. full and spearing in on the leg stump, gayle's bat comes down in an arc, just outside the line and he squeeses it past the leg stump, down to fine leg",5
16869,8.04E+11,10.4, backs -999 to the leg side and taps a length delivery to the off side.,5
16870,8.04E+11,10.3," full in length, on the off stump line, smith shuffles right across, ends up outside off stump and tucks it to albie morker at backward square leg , within the circle, and he misfields. they get -999 runs.",5
16871,8.04E+11,10.2," fullish, on the leg stump line, tucked past square leg for a -999",5
16872,8.04E+11,10.1, full and straight and a rare dot ball. hit straight back down the track.,5
16873,8.04E+11,8.6," full-toss on the off, slapped down to point to end the over",15
16874,8.04E+11,8.6," full and down the leg side, that's a terrible ball with the keeper standing up. five wides!",15
16875,8.04E+11,8.5," slower ball, it's the off-cutted, worked through square-leg for a -999",15
16876,8.04E+11,8.4," short of a length and on the stumps, pulled awkwardly down to long-on",15
16877,8.04E+11,8.3," very full and on the pads, attempted yorker, worked through leg",15
16878,8.04E+11,8.2," fullish and on the off, smashed -999 over midwicket. that's a big hit from gayle. yet another -999, rather",15

17866,8.04E+11,1.5," short of a length and outside the off, left alone to the keeper. strange scenes here. after that stunning catch karthik has taken over the gloves from dhoni. now the captain is at mid-off. perhaps he wants to bowl later on?",1
17867,8.04E+11,1.4," stunner! that is an absolute ripper from dinesh karthik in the slips cordon. it's a wide, swinging, full delivery from rp singh and smith has a real go at it. the ball flies off the outside edge really quick and wide. karthik throws himself full length to his left and catches this -999 with both hands. that is a catch right -999 of the top drawer. you won't see too many more like that.",1

17871,8.04E+11,19.6," low full toss pulled high in the air off the bottomn of the bat and that's a poor piece of keeping from akmal who calls for it... and then fluffs it. that may be amusing, but let's hope for his sake that it doesn't come down to a run...",17
17872,8.04E+11,19.5, low full toss driven wide of long-off who races and races and finally cuts it off with a lunge - good fielding,17
17873,8.04E+11,19.4, wideish down off and an appeal as taylor cuts into the ground - the noise was likely to have been bat into ground,17

17879,8.04E+11,14.4," hello, massive, to coin a mark nicholasonian phrase - a huge swing straight over long-off",13

17881,8.04E+11,14.2, driven -999 tamely wide of mid-on and there's another referral - mcmillan's looking a combination of worried and furious but needn't worry as the direct shy just isn't quite enough,13

18091,8.04E+11,0.3," phew, that was close. angelo's wobbly seam-up stuff is troubling the batsmen already. good length outside off, coming back in. a thick inside edge just misses the off stump",3

18101,8.04E+11,17.4, the best of the lot. low full toss on middle and mathews times the flick past midwicket. impressive placement as well earns sl -999 and that could be the game,12
18102,8.04E+11,17.3, pokes -999 from his body outside off and gets a thick edge which flies to third man who runs around and dives but only gets a hand on it to parry for -999.,12
18103,8.04E+11,17.3, good change in length. just a little too high. the bouncer is too high,12
18104,8.04E+11,17.2," mighty close to another dismissal. full and wide, mathews backs -999 and goes for a drive but the tail back in takes the inside edge, which spins and twirls -999 from the stumps",12

18336,8.04E+11,14.1, that will help relieve some pressure as fletcher clears long on as he picks up a delivery at leg stump,19
18337,8.04E+11,7.6," dragged down short outside off, fletcher almost swings himself off his feet and doesn't make contact",7
18338,8.04E+11,7.5," that's very smart batting, he steps right across his crease and then slog-sweeps a full delivery into the stands at deep midwicket. excellent use of his crease",7
18339,8.04E+11,7.4," full at the stumps, opens the face and pushes through point to deep cover",7
18340,8.04E+11,7.3," another ripper! huge spin from off stump, defeats samuels' rather expansive drive",7
18341,8.04E+11,7.2, played to backward point,7
18342,8.04E+11,7.1," what a delivery! that's a beauty. defeats samuels all ends up as he lunges forward, the ball dips then spins sharply to beat the outside edge. does well not to tumble -999 of his crease",7
18343,8.04E+11,5.6," speared in at middle and leg, pushed firmly back to the bowler and that completes a -999 maiden. terrific effort",0
18344,8.04E+11,5.5," dragged down a touch shorter, goes onto the back foot and drives to cover",0

18346,8.04E+11,5.3," tossed up full at the stumps, driven to cover",0
18347,8.04E+11,5.2, dragged on! the legspinner breaks through. charles trying to guide this to third man and it takes a bottom edge into his off stump. too close for the shot.,0
18348,8.04E+11,5.1," turn there, takes a leading edge into the off side",0
18349,8.04E+11,3.6," tickled off the pads to short fine leg...good start by vandersay, he should have had a -999",1
18350,8.04E+11,3.5, a shorter delivery which is pulled back to the bowler,1
18351,8.04E+11,3.4," slides on with the arm, cramps him for room, chopped to short third man",1
18352,8.04E+11,3.3, pushed back to the bowler,1
18353,8.04E+11,3.2," dropped, oh dear sri lanka! he came down the pitch, heaved into the leg side, picked -999 midwicket but kapugedera spilled it as he charged in. seemed to over-run the chance, really.",1
18354,8.04E+11,3.1," starts full and straight, hint of turn, pushed to square leg",1
18355,8.04E+11,1.6," appeal for caught behind! a lovely delivery, turned from around middle and beat fletcher as he lunged forward",10
18356,8.04E+11,1.5," and now he goes to the on side, stretches for this delivery which is well outside off and slog-sweeps it to deep midwicket",10
18357,8.04E+11,1.4," down the pitch, this grips a touch, he's not quite to the pitch and defends to midwicket",10
18358,8.04E+11,1.3," nice comeback, he holds this delivery back, it's a touch shorter, takes a thick inside edge between his legs",10
18359,8.04E+11,1.2," fantastic stroke, that's how to make a statement...swift footwork, gets to the pitch, and launches it over wide long off into the stands",10
18360,8.04E+11,1.1, goes back and tucks to midwicket,10
18361,8.04E+11,16.6," shortish and outside off, mushy goes for the cut and finds nothing",4
18362,8.04E+11,16.5," good length ball, directed to sweeper cover",4
18363,8.04E+11,16.4," cross seamer that does not bounce much, but the lack of pace did him in. mahmudullah goes for the slog and inside edges onto his pads",4
18364,8.04E+11,16.3," where is it, where is it, wonders mushfiqur as he premeditates a ramp. the ball though has gone off his bat, popped off his shoulder and was somewhere near the edge of the pitch on the off side. lovely bowling from watson though, went very full and followed the batsman as he darted outside off",4
18365,8.04E+11,16.2," didn't get a hold of the pull shot, probably because it got too much height on it and had to drag it from outside off. watson keeps doing the business at the back end",4
18366,8.04E+11,16.1," shortish and outside off, sliced to deep third man",4
18367,8.04E+11,12.6," that's at his full pace on off stump, pushed to mid-on",11
18368,8.04E+11,12.5," slips in the slower ball, which kicks up off the pitch and foils mahmudullah's timing. hits bat, deflects off thigh pad and into the leg side",11
18369,8.04E+11,12.4," loads more behind that though! it was short, it allowed the freedom mahmudllah needed to free the arms and -999 came the front foot pull and -999 it was tonked over square leg",11
18370,8.04E+11,12.3," excellent timing, but the key here was how mahmudullah waited just enough to beat the man at point. nothing more than an extended defence from the batsman.",11
18371,8.04E+11,12.2, taps a back of a length delivery through to point,11
18372,8.04E+11,12.1, he's been very good in bringing the angled face down on back of a length balls. another -999 to third man,11
18373,8.04E+11,6.6, pummeled! he has flat-batted a shortish delivery over wide long-off and the reason he was able to do that was because of the width on it. superb strike,12
18374,8.04E+11,6.5," generates some zip from the surface and shakib is surprised by the bounce on offer. he had been set to steer the shortish delivery on middle to third man, but gets more trouble than it was worth",12
18375,8.04E+11,6.4, waits for the shortish delivery outside off and glides it to deep third man,12
18376,8.04E+11,6.3," oooh, picture perfect cover drive but mithun has picked -999 watson at short cover just as perfectly",12
18377,8.04E+11,6.2," defended into the off side, but short cover is on hand",12
18378,8.04E+11,6.1," rushes the new bowler, comes down the track and carves a back of a length ball down the ground. marsh reached -999 with his left hand, could't grab it",12
18379,8.04E+11,3.6," and it continues! the first shot he has played that has made him look good, and sounded like he had timed the pants off it, goes straight to cover",9
18380,8.04E+11,3.5," heave no, nothing to show and its another length ball that has been let go! sabbir's playing a very weird innings here.",9
18381,8.04E+11,3.4," still not perfectly timed, the bat face turned in his hand, but he was at least looking to hit it straighter. takes a half-volley and thumps it to long-on",9
18382,8.04E+11,3.3," ooof, that's a dreadful slog. he could have used a straight bat and found a boundary, but he looks for midwicket and a length ball goes unpunished",9
18383,8.04E+11,3.2, the magic eight ball says smash! it was a tad too full and sabbir hits it with all his might through mid-off.,9
18384,8.04E+11,3.1," good length ball, angled in, sabbir defends and gets an inside edge",9
18385,8.04E+11,18.3," oooh, gifts them a short ball and faulkner cracks it through the covers, that's the victory",5
18386,8.04E+11,18.2, pitched on leg and rips across to off stump. even faulkner is very nervous. barely managed to block that,5
18387,8.04E+11,18.1," flighted delivery on middle, driven to long-off for a simple -999",5
18388,8.04E+11,16.6," that was the cutter on leg stump, maxwell goes for the pull and gets it off the toe end of the bat",13
18389,8.04E+11,16.5," but when it is at normal pace, it keeps sitting up! maxwell presents a straight bat and extends his elbows so it carries over long-on",13
18390,8.04E+11,16.4, returns to the cutter and rips maxwell open. gripped into the pitch on a good length outside leg and sashayed past the outside edge,13
18391,8.04E+11,16.3," phew! that's a top stroke from maxwell. it seems to be the -999 at his normal pace, and it was on leg stump too, maxwell flicks it -999",13
18392,8.04E+11,16.2," gone now! and its the cutter again! marsh couldn't get anything on the last -999, this time he gets a leading edge while prodding from the crease. it leaps up, shakib at point runs back to track it down. good, pressure catch.",13
18393,8.04E+11,16.1," pitches outside leg, drifts right over off stump! that could easily have uprooted marsh's stumps. he was feeling for the ball, but the cutter defeated him",13
18394,8.04E+11,14.6," hit all along the ground to long-off. if he can keep a sensible head, this should be australia's",2
18395,8.04E+11,14.5," flighted on middle, maxwell nudges it towards midwicket",2
18396,8.04E+11,14.4, speared -999 to deep cover,2
18397,8.04E+11,14.3," flighted on middle, driven back at the bowler",2
18398,8.04E+11,14.2," cricket 101, how not to play a full toss. it was lobbed up by shakib, on leg stump. warner was making room, perhaps thinking about only a -999. but seeing such a bad ball, he thought he should do more. went for a flick but hit it right back at the bowler",2
18399,8.04E+11,14.1," tossed up on middle and leg, warner pats it back to the bowler",2
18400,8.04E+11,1.6," khawaja dances -999, manufactures a full ball, adjusts late to the spin, and clips to mid-on; a fumble allows a -999",5
18401,8.04E+11,1.5," straying onto the pads, from round the stumps, picked -999 to deep midwicket",5
18402,8.04E+11,1.4," fired in at 91ks, khawaja sits back and flicks through midwicket",5
18403,8.04E+11,1.3," full and goes straight on outside off, eased past the covers on the front foot",5
18404,8.04E+11,1.2," flat and slides on outside off, watson's first ball is pushed to the covers",5
18405,8.04E+11,1.1," tossed up and spins outside off, khawaja gets forward and drives to long-off",5
18406,8.04E+11,16.6," good delivery to end.  a low full toss on off is very hard to hit, pushed to cover. an efficient over for nz",11
18407,8.04E+11,16.5," slower delivery on off, slapped to point",11
18408,8.04E+11,16.4," full and straight, taylor shuffles across and drills to long-on",11
18409,8.04E+11,16.3," short delivery on middle, good change in length. taylor takes his eyes off it but gets some bat on his pull, -999 to a labouring irfan at fine leg",11
18410,8.04E+11,16.2," good yorker outside off, squeezed to deep point and taylor hurries back for the second as a late decision. a good throw would have had taylor",11
18411,8.04E+11,16.1, what execution. superb. premeditated the paddle and did it easily. amir fires it full and wide outside off but taylor gets far enough and drags it over short fine leg.,11
18412,8.04E+11,15.6," tip and run, good from taylor. pats a decent delivery to point for a quick -999",8
18413,8.04E+11,15.5," flat on middle, a thick inside edge makes its way to square leg",8
18414,8.04E+11,15.4, pushed down to short third man again. taylor labours through and a direct hit would have been interesting,8

18416,8.04E+11,15.2," gone. anderson's cameo ends. a googly outside off, anderson looks to go down the ground but mis-times the drive. skews it off the outside half of the bat down to long-off. malik takes a sitter.",8
18417,8.04E+11,15.1," -999 more, runs coming all too easily. a very full delivery on middle and leg, anderson brings -999 all his power to flick the ball past midwicket for -999",8

18422,8.04E+11,14.3," bowled im. what a big -999 that is. a great comeback from sami after -999 loose deliveries. gets the length right, on off and middle, tailing back in just enough. guptill tries a deft dab to third man but that inward movement is responsible for guptill tapping the ball back onto his stumps. what an innings though",4
18423,8.04E+11,14.2," another poor delivery. good length down leg, guptill fails to connect with a flick. hit on the pad",4

18436,8.04E+11,1.6," a good length delivery on off and middle, blocked from the crease. decent end but an expensive over",13
18437,8.04E+11,1.5," what a shot that is. kw at his very best. gets on top of the bounce from a seven-foot bowler. and then laces a cut in the gap at point. races -999 to the fence, awesome to watch.",13
18438,8.04E+11,1.4, too straight from irfan and kw is a master of that stroke. just whips the ball in the gap at square leg for a couple. poor line,13
18439,8.04E+11,1.3," a back of a length on middle and leg, worked quietly towards square leg for -999",13
18440,8.04E+11,1.2," whew, my of my. that is absolutely humongous. guptill has had enough of prodding, he backs -999 and gets a fullish length delivery. absolutely clobbered miles in the air and it hangs there for a minute before descening over the long-on boundary",13
18441,8.04E+11,1.1," a nice start from irfan too. on a  fullish length on off and middle, guptill shows the respect the delivery deserves. defended",13

18497,8.04E+11,17.2, driven solidly but to the fielder at cover,6
18498,8.04E+11,17.1," very full, squirted -999 to cover",6
18499,8.04E+11,14.6, full toss cracked to short-extra,6
18500,8.04E+11,14.5," fuller ball punched to mid-off - morgan it is, -999 think, and he throws down the stumps at the non-striker's end and hits! that almost never happens by an england fielder. not -999",6
18501,8.04E+11,14.4," ouch - a shorter ball and he gets into a tangle, allowing it to hit him. he then regrets that decision and is down on his haunches",6
18502,8.04E+11,14.3," cor, he timed this! lovely flow of the bat down the ground but can only pick up a -999",6
18503,8.04E+11,14.2," that's well bowled, straight and squick but also well played, opening the face to third man",6
18504,8.04E+11,14.2," miles down the leg side. lovely ball to a right-hander, buuuut...",6
18505,8.04E+11,14.1, full but wide and crashed -999 to cover,6
18506,8.04E+11,13.6," that's more like it! a massive blow into the stands as najibullah, aka najib, flogs ali over the top",13
18507,8.04E+11,13.5," much fuller ball, turned off his toes",13
18508,8.04E+11,13.4, steps back and cracks this through cover - timing it nicely but only for -999,13
18509,8.04E+11,13.3, but it's much too straight this time and najibullah simply turns it around the corner for -999 - nicely done,13
18510,8.04E+11,13.2, straighter ball which is blocked,13
18511,8.04E+11,13.1," fast, straight and shenwari clips for a walked -999",13
18512,8.04E+11,12.6, flighted on leg and nudged for -999,4
18513,8.04E+11,12.5," oh, nabi's lured into this - well bowled by rashid. he gave it a touch more air, and nabi tried to loft him over the top but miscues to jordan at wide long-on",4
18514,8.04E+11,12.4," squirts this -999 to the off side and they steal a -999 - but only just! he makes his ground in the end, with a dive",4
18515,8.04E+11,12.3, lovely back-cut for -999 as rashid's line strays,4
18516,8.04E+11,12.2," tossed up, shenwari goes for a massive heave over midwicket but misses and is hit on the pads. but nowhere near being given -999 - outside the line",4
18517,8.04E+11,12.1, outside off and he plays and misses,4
18518,8.04E+11,12.1," yikes! miles wide of the off-stump and buttler, who looks peeved from his missed stumping earlier in rashid's spell, collects neatly",4
18519,8.04E+11,6.6," very full, almost a yorker, but outside off and rashid drives solidly to cover",3
18520,8.04E+11,6.5," short of a length, he drops this -999 to point for a well-run -999",3
18521,8.04E+11,6.4, fuller this time and rashid steps to leg before carving him -999 to deep extra,3
18522,8.04E+11,6.3," sharp, sharp bouncer - well dealt with. he ducks",3
18523,8.04E+11,6.2," swing and a miss outside off! short, quick and a bit of a desperate hack across the line",3
18524,8.04E+11,6.1," outside off, defended -999 to the off side",3
18525,8.04E+11,5.6, cracked off the back foot,8
18526,8.04E+11,5.4," superb shot - crunching, powerful, flat--999 cut behind square! power...",8
18527,8.04E+11,5.3, swing and a miss outside off,8
18528,8.04E+11,5.2," again very short, and dropped down smartly but only for a -999",8
18529,8.04E+11,5.1, this rides up awkwardly but he times it neatly off his hip,8
18530,8.04E+11,14.6," and more! moves down the track, again he's not shown his -999 too early. shakib can't do nothing about it. he's already let go of the ball when he sees pandya is halfway down the pitch and then -999 comes the extra cover loft. that's clever too, that's an area that is usually unprotected",11
18531,8.04E+11,14.5," superb batting! unlike raina, pandya makes his move down the track only after the ball leaves shakib's hand. so here a pretty, flighted ball on middle and leg is banished down the ground. so much power behind that. beats long-on comfortably",11
18532,8.04E+11,14.4, driven into the covers,11
18533,8.04E+11,14.3," literally runs -999 at shakib, who does it superbly. loops it wide, to see if he can stump the batsman. raina just about plants the open face on it and secures a -999",11
18534,8.04E+11,14.2," tossed up on leg stump, nudged towards long-on. thoughts of a second, but there were too many fielders closing in",11
18535,8.04E+11,14.1," big old grin on shakib's face, because he knows he has given raina an absolute treat and raina graciously says no thanks. loopy full toss down leg, with fine leg inside the circle, and the sweep shot does not beat him",11
18536,8.04E+11,10.6, comes down the track and al-amin does well to slant the ball past raina's reach outside off,14
18537,8.04E+11,10.5, heaved -999 over midwicket. that's -999 in -999 and the change of bat is working wonders for raina. al-amin and his lengths have not been good when the pressure has been on him. short balls at his full pace aren't the most threatening,14
18538,8.04E+11,10.4," is that another drop? harsh to call it, since shuvagata was right on the edge of the square leg fence. he must have been worried of going over. reached for the ball after raina has swished it high towards the short boundary, can't pull it off",14
18539,8.04E+11,10.2," dropped! oh, you can't do that with kohli! certainly not after you've deceived him. kohli was jumping down the track, and is surprised by the bounce on it. panics and tries to power the ball -999. the ball hits the splice and comes back at al-amin, it was looping back so he had enough time. sticks -999 a right hand during his followthrough and shells it",14
18540,8.04E+11,10.1," he's changed his bat, and this -999 seems to suit him better. as does the full pace of al-amin, coupled with width and just the length raina likes because he can get under. slapped through the covers",14
18541,8.04E+11,7.6," jumps up worried about the bounce mash is getting, but it is also slow. the flick pops up in the air, but it falls safe since deep square leg is back",4
18542,8.04E+11,7.5," he's chopped onto his stumps playing this very stroke before - but at mash's slower pace, he's much more comfortable with the glide towards point",4
18543,8.04E+11,7.4," 129 kph, that seemed like he was beaten for pace. good length ball leaps -999 past raina's tentative poke -999 from his body",4
18544,8.04E+11,7.3, waits for the shortish and the slower delivery on off stump and directs it to point,4
18545,8.04E+11,7.2, steps forward to a fuller ball and presents the straight bat to long-on,4
18546,8.04E+11,7.1, strays down leg to kohli and the flick off the hips skims -999 to the man at deep square leg,4
18547,8.04E+11,15.6," stays back to a flatter delivery on middle, worked towards midwicket",9
18548,8.04E+11,15.5," worked down to long-on, soumya came down the track and yorked himself",9
18549,8.04E+11,15.3, lunges forward and sweeps to deep midwicket,9
18550,8.04E+11,15.2," dhoni went up straight -999! that's another round-arm dart and soumya tried to open the face of the bat and run it -999 fine. did the ball deflect right off the face and into dhoni's gloves? there was no sound though, and snicko confirms that.",9
18551,8.04E+11,15.1," huge! but did he time it properly? does it matter? soumya gets down low for a sweep, and a 100 kph dart soars into the night sky and lands beyond deep square leg",9
18552,8.04E+11,11.6," good length ball outside off, steered towards point",8
18553,8.04E+11,11.5," fires it in on leg stump, shakib nudges it around the corner",8
18554,8.04E+11,11.4," that's pummeled! shakib's shakin here! he had the room, he had the length to get under, he has the power and the slog over midwicket comes -999 to perfection",8
18555,8.04E+11,11.3, eased through the covers as he steps forward to a flighted ball outside off,8
18556,8.04E+11,11.2," plants it full on middle and off, gets some turn but mahmudullah negotiates it with a defensive bat",8
18557,8.04E+11,11.1," speared in quick and straight, mash runs down the pitch, but makes too much room while doing so. jadeja's darts are too quick and they go through him. boy, mash's a proper pinch hitter. doesn't waste any time in the middle",8
18558,8.04E+11,6.6," that's well bowled. loops it up to bring -999 the drive, but it was wider so tamim would lose his balance if he went after it. he does. and he does. uppish drive through the covers",8
18559,8.04E+11,6.5, flighted outside off and slapped to long-off,8
18560,8.04E+11,6.4," that was unnecessary, and it wasn't particularly well timed. it was a top-edge, to a reverse sweep, and this time the ball lobs bumrah at short third man",8
18561,8.04E+11,6.3, worked -999 into the leg side,8
18562,8.04E+11,6.2, not quite short enough for the pull shot and tamim seemed to be hurried in the stroke as well. ashwin's variations mixed with his accuracy are troubling bangladesh. but they are not losing their heads over it,8
18563,8.04E+11,6.1," good length ball on off stump, steered to point for a -999",8
18564,8.04E+11,1.6," closes the face too early and the ball - even at 139 kph - comes off the pitch a touch off pace. outside edge to third man as bangalore roars their support for the home team. bangladesh have been playing in mirpur a lot lately, which screamed for them passionately. not much of that here",3
18565,8.04E+11,1.5, 140kph and that pace coupled with a fuller length leaves mithun with too little time to make up his mind. defends with half a stride forward and gets an inside edge,3
18566,8.04E+11,1.4," crisp sound off the bat as mithun steps forward and defends. ah, test cricket. -999've missed you",3
18567,8.04E+11,1.3, good batting there. dabs into the cover and runs. good ball on off stump yields runs.,3
18568,8.04E+11,1.2, that's the flamingo half way down the pitch! bumrah's got his head screwed right as he cramps tamim up,3
18569,8.04E+11,1.1," 129 kph, back of a length and on off stump, pushed into the covers",3
18570,8.04E+11,14.6," darted on top of off, watson backs -999 slightly and punches to the off-side sweeper",3
18571,8.04E+11,14.5," afridi fires a yorker, almost 100ks, dug back",3
18572,8.04E+11,14.4," full on off, whipped nicely to long-on",3
18573,8.04E+11,14.3," short and outside off, drags a pull to long-on",3
18574,8.04E+11,14.2," faster and flat-arm, punched to cover on the back foot",3
18575,8.04E+11,14.1," pitched up and outside off, eased to cover on the front foot",3
18576,8.04E+11,10.6," full and slides on middle at 93ks, maxi goes low and spanks it -999 to the midwicket boundary with a sweep",13
18577,8.04E+11,10.5," afridi attacks the pads again with a full ball, maxi whirls his wrists and hits it to deep midwicket",13
18578,8.04E+11,10.4," on the pads from round the -999, twirled through midwicket",13
18579,8.04E+11,10.3," tossed around off, stops a bit on the batsman, chipped in front of long-on",13
18580,8.04E+11,10.2, maxi unleashes the reverse sweep to a fourth-stump ball. he probably top edged it over the keeper,13
18581,8.04E+11,10.1, smith gets on the front foot and clips a -999 to wide long-on,13
18582,8.04E+11,18.6," off-stump full toss, which is sliced -999 to the deep point boundary",14
18583,8.04E+11,18.5," full length on middle, misses the yorker. lifted straight down the ground for -999",14
18584,8.04E+11,18.3," too full and outside off, malik lofts it in the air... smith sprints from long-off, plunges forward, but the ball drops just in front of him",14
18585,8.04E+11,18.2," full toss following the batsman, who was backing -999. hacked to cover",14
18586,8.04E+11,18.1," short and outside off, flat batted to long-off",14
18587,8.04E+11,16.6," yorker on middle and off, clipped -999 to deep midwicket",10
18588,8.04E+11,16.5," pretty full on off, slogged to long-on",10
18589,8.04E+11,16.4," banged in short and outside off, hooks and top-edges it over vacant slips. watto has a wry smile",10
18590,8.04E+11,16.3," yorker aimed at the base of middle, squeezed to midwicket. they hare across for -999",10
18591,8.04E+11,16.2," overpitched on off, slammed to long-on",10
18592,8.04E+11,16.1," yorker on off, malik hangs back and belts it to long-off",10
18593,8.04E+11,9.6," worked off the pads, with soft hands, behind square on the leg side",6
18594,8.04E+11,9.5," slider on off, punched to long-off",6
18595,8.04E+11,9.4, umar goes deep in the crease and whips an off-stump ball through midwicket,6
18596,8.04E+11,9.3," short on off, camps back and punches a -999 to long-on",6
18597,8.04E+11,9.2," fired across off from round the -999, umar aims a cut and edges it fine past the keeper",6
18598,8.04E+11,9.1," full and straight, smartly placed through backward square leg",6
18599,8.04E+11,8.6," short on off, umar gets forward and jabs it back to the bowler off the inside half of the bat",11
18600,8.04E+11,8.5," faulkner pulls pace off this outside off and beats the batsman, they pinch a bye",11
18601,8.04E+11,8.4," too full and around off, right in the slot. latif clears his front leg, unleashes a clean, powerful swing and sends it sailing over long-on",11
18602,8.04E+11,8.3," dipping full toss on off, leading edge drops in front of cover",11
18603,8.04E+11,8.2," back of a length on middle, umar thrashes it -999 to the leg side, khawaja dives to his left from deep square leg, loses grip of the ball, tumbles and kicks it to the boundary. that looks a -999 to me. the tv umpire disagrees. nonetheless, good commitment from khawaja",11
18604,8.04E+11,8.1," back of a length on off, pulled through backward square leg",11
18605,8.04E+11,6.6," better short ball on off, umar rolls his wrists and pulls it in front of square",17
18606,8.04E+11,6.5," length and outside off, umar beats mid-off to his right, this rocketed -999. drilled it with great authority",17
18607,8.04E+11,6.4," umar dances -999 again, watson shortens his length, umar, however, puts it -999 to the midwicket boundary. pulled -999!",17

18613,8.04E+11,19.4, phangiso steps back and carves it -999 to the off side but without power,4
18614,8.04E+11,19.3, reverse-switches a full toss to point - straight to him,4
18615,8.04E+11,19.2," a slower ball, obviously - it's bravo after all - but it's a brilliant delivery. morris completely deceived, attempting a slog outside off through midwicket. misses it utterly",4
18616,8.04E+11,19.1," wide of the off stump, morris clatters it through cover for -999",4
18617,8.04E+11,9.6," well, at last, a boundary. and a very rare stray from bravo down the leg side. de kock capitalises with a pull around the corner",7

18619,8.04E+11,9.4, got him! no? big noise outside off as de kock attempted a flourishing drive - definitely a noise there. perhaps bat/pad or bat on turf,7
18620,8.04E+11,9.3, slower ball - defended,7
18621,8.04E+11,9.2," so close to being caught here - bouncer which gets onto him much quicker than he anticipated, ballooning a pull to gayle at short midwicket. he attempts a run -999, too, does gayle, but bravo fluffs it",7
18622,8.04E+11,9.1, defended to backward point,7
18623,8.04E+11,6.6," should get -999 here - and they do, as de kock places this smartly through midwicket",5
18624,8.04E+11,6.5, on middle and turned to leg,5
18625,8.04E+11,6.4, solidly defended on middle,5
18626,8.04E+11,6.3, a little turn off his legs. benn's line is too leg-side,5
18627,8.04E+11,6.2," again, he gives this immense flight - a real teaser on middle-and-leg. de villiers cracks it through cover with good timing",5
18628,8.04E+11,6.1, flighted on middle,5
18629,8.04E+11,19.4," he's dropped him - a cut by ramdin to amla who let it fly through his hands! west indies win. tahir was superb - in fact, all today's spinners were (not least chris gayle). in the end, a decent win for west indies - on what was actually a really difficult pitch. slow, low, difficult to time the ball.",9

18632,8.04E+11,19.2," he's picked this -999 up though - my god, he's hit this miles! it's a huge blow over midwicket, the crisp clunk of the bat reverberating around a joyous crowd. wow - what a blow",9
18633,8.04E+11,19.1," a slower ball outside off, shorter too, and brathwaite swings and misses! he is not picking these shorter balls up at all",9

18635,8.04E+11,18.5," he's got him - it's a huge -999! samuels stepped to leg, as he so often has in this innings, and tried to pull the ball over midwicket but could only sky it to ab de villiers running in at long-on",11
18636,8.04E+11,18.4," wide of the off stump, samuels once again edges it down to third man for -999! a square cut straight down into the ground. south africa look peeved by it, but really, if it's short and wide ...",11

18646,8.04E+11,13.6," gone! wasteful slap by bravo to a fullish delivery outside off, opening the face, to backward point",3
18647,8.04E+11,13.5, phangiso lets it through for a -999. sloppy,3
18648,8.04E+11,13.4," done him in the flight! samuels plays a horrid poke, uppishly, but short of the man at cover",3
18649,8.04E+11,13.3," oh well bowled, much quicker and samuels exposes all -999 stumps this time, while defending",3
18650,8.04E+11,13.2," way too short again, though samuels' cut finds short extra",3
18651,8.04E+11,13.1, short. cut.,3

18656,8.04E+11,11.3," full and straight, driven past the bowler",4
18657,8.04E+11,11.2, a slower ball which he works off middle to leg,4
18658,8.04E+11,11.1," outside off, a huge swipe but he's skied this to the moon and back! faf is under it at cover or thereabouts, and takes it comfortably, tumbling to the deck but pouching it safely",4
18659,8.04E+11,8.6, classically driven cover-drive,6

18819,8.04E+11,2.2," shot! sails over maxwell's head at deep square leg! it was a length ball at a faster pace on leg and middle, dhawan plants his foot forward and swings across the line, great timing and balance on the crease",9
18820,8.04E+11,2.1," good length on middle and off, not coming on to the bat, dhawan pushes off the front foot to mid off",9
18821,8.04E+11,2.1," hazlewood falls over in his follow through after delivering a short of a length ball down leg side, dhawan can't connect with the pull",9
18822,8.04E+11,18.6," boom! boom boom rashid? will that catch on? no, probably not - great hit over long-off",9
18823,8.04E+11,18.5, slogs this to deep square leg,9
18824,8.04E+11,18.4," down the leg side, zadran attempts to whip but can't connect",9
18825,8.04E+11,18.3," short and slow, zadran steps back and sort of slaps it, or tries to, but it bobbles back to russell",9
18826,8.04E+11,18.2, mistimed down the ground. though it's his lack of timing which affords -999,9
18827,8.04E+11,18.1," a huge slog across the line but he can only sky it into the leg-side, and fletcher takes it comfortably - that was in the air for a long, long time",9
18828,8.04E+11,14.6," power! slower-ball bouncer and nabi waits, and waits, and waits, before pulling in front of square for -999",10
18829,8.04E+11,14.5," full bunger, bunged off to the off side",10
18830,8.04E+11,14.4," slower ball this time, nicely stroked to long-off",10
18831,8.04E+11,14.3," tries it again and connects this time, lofting it over cover, albeit without any timing",10
18832,8.04E+11,14.2," windy, wooly, swish of the blade, leaning back and dreaming of crashing this over extra cover, but his dreams don't come true",10
18833,8.04E+11,14.1, too straight and he clips this to deep square leg,10
18834,8.04E+11,12.6, uppishly forced to deep mid-on,5
18835,8.04E+11,12.5," ah, lovely little tickle there from najib past fine-leg",5
18836,8.04E+11,12.4, again defended to point,5
18837,8.04E+11,12.3," back-cut to point. he thinks about a run but the fielding is alert - alive, energetic, dominant",5
18838,8.04E+11,12.2, carved -999 to the off side,5
18839,8.04E+11,12.1," on middle-and-leg, it's defended",5
18840,8.04E+11,11.6, forced to long-off,4
18841,8.04E+11,11.5," a slowish, loopy delivery and a touch shorter, he tries to loft it but can't get underneath it and bravo holds onto the skier at long-on",4
18842,8.04E+11,11.4, quick -999 -999 to cover,4
18843,8.04E+11,11.2," very slow - -999 don't have the mph for you unfortunately, but it can't have been more than 65mph. driven -999 to mid-off",4
18844,8.04E+11,11.1, a slower ball which he dabs -999 to cover,4
18845,8.04E+11,10.6, this is nicely timed by gulbadin who meets the ball and drives it crisply to the left of mid-on - but it's well fielded,1
18846,8.04E+11,10.5," short of a length, clobbered to mid-off",1
18847,8.04E+11,10.4," beats him! well bowled, just outside the off stump and the turn beats gulbadin's hopeful poke",1
18848,8.04E+11,10.3, off the mark nudging to leg,1
18849,8.04E+11,10.2," late-cut to sammy at the first and lone slip who takes a very slick, smart catch, low to his right. shenwari looks aghast and confused at his stroke, as indeed we all are",1
18850,8.04E+11,10.1, wants to turn it to leg but can't,1
18851,8.04E+11,5.6," tame dismissal. shahzad danced down the pitch, stepping to leg and hit him straight to mid-off who took a decent, if facile, low catch",1
18852,8.04E+11,5.5, badree sees shahzad coming and drops it short,1
18853,8.04E+11,5.4," walks at badree, defending it back to the bowler",1
18854,8.04E+11,5.3," much quicker ball - shahzad tries to cut, and does cut, but straight to point",1
18855,8.04E+11,5.2, well played - plants his front foot solidly and sweeps with power,1
18856,8.04E+11,5.1," leg-spinner on middle, stanikzai comes down the pitch to defend",1
18857,8.04E+11,2.6, flicked off his pads to retain the strike,11
18858,8.04E+11,2.5," capitalises on this shorter ball which is much too straight and unthreatening, and he hooks him fine for -999!",11
18859,8.04E+11,2.4, an extravagant defensive to a slower ball from brathwaite,11
18860,8.04E+11,2.3," lovely stroke! not quite timed, but lofted it over the leg-side for -999, and the storm is -999",11
18861,8.04E+11,2.2," tries to mow this over midwicket but it's a touch too full, the ball bobbling -999 to the off side",11
18862,8.04E+11,2.1, full but on his pads and he flicks to leg,11
18863,8.04E+11,1.6, defended on the front foot,3
18864,8.04E+11,1.5," bowled him! the wrong'un and ghani doesn't pick it, the ball turning nicely through the gate",3
18865,8.04E+11,1.4," very full. shazad, remaining back in his crease, defends on the back foot and literally walks a -999",3
18866,8.04E+11,1.3," short and straight, allowing shahzad to tuck him around the corner for a couple",3
18867,8.04E+11,1.2," shazad, fleet of foot, dances down the pitch to work it to leg",3
18868,8.04E+11,1.1, flighted on middle. shahzad smothers,3
18869,8.04E+11,0.6, driven back to the bowler,5
18870,8.04E+11,0.5," bosh! steps back and slaps this over the bowler for -999. didn't quite time in and it plugs in the outfield, but he got a good enough connection on it",5
18871,8.04E+11,0.4," a confident drive to mid-off, standing tall",5
18872,8.04E+11,0.3," full and straight. ghani, the right-handed 19-year-old, defends",5
18873,8.04E+11,0.2," down the leg side, he goes for a flick and is caught behind! russell appeals, but ramdin, diving low to his left, isn't sure whether he took it cleanly or not. replays show the ball found its way into ramdin's fingers but, as he tumbled to his left, the ball touched the ground so it's not -999",5
18874,8.04E+11,0.1, very good yorker! shahzad just gets his bat down in time,5
18875,8.04E+11,19.6," pulled to leg, and afghanistan notch a famous, brilliant win!",3
18876,8.04E+11,19.5," a full toss, pushed down the ground - he can't get hold of it and hobbles through for a -999",3
18877,8.04E+11,19.4," full toss but only for -999, pushed to deep midwicket",3
18878,8.04E+11,19.3," lofted it high, high, long, long and here comes naib who takes an amazing, brave, brilliant running catch! what an incredible take under pressure, falling awkwardly and he looks in some pain. stunning!",3
18879,8.04E+11,19.2, down the pitch and swings and misses again! dot ball,3
18880,8.04E+11,19.1, swings and misses! dot ball,3
18881,8.04E+11,18.6," another yorker attempted but brathwaite calmly, cooly, turns it to leg for a -999",15
18882,8.04E+11,18.5," he's second-tiered him. a massive, massive blow as naib offers a full-toss. monstrous blow over midwicket",15
18883,8.04E+11,18.4," he's off balance, trying to loft this over cover but afghanistan have another -999! a loose shot in the circumstances, picking -999 deep extra cover who, cool as a cucumber, takes an easy catch",15
18884,8.04E+11,18.3," speared into his legs, naib is convinced he's got his man, jogging backwards while appealing, then falling onto his backside!",15
18885,8.04E+11,18.2, shot. absolutely nailed it over long-off. he really can hit a laaaang ball!,15
18886,8.04E+11,18.1," spearing into his pads, driven to mid-off",15
18887,8.04E+11,13.6," goddim! darted this in, bravo tries to work it off his pads but misses and he's trapped in front",3
18888,8.04E+11,13.5, short and wide but bravo's cut can't find the gap,3
18889,8.04E+11,13.4," punched to the misfielding cover who, as befitting his title, misfields",3
18890,8.04E+11,13.3, an injudicious reverse sweep to a delivery too full to be sweeping,3
18891,8.04E+11,13.2, another easy -999 to leg as bravo turns his wrists on it,3
18892,8.04E+11,13.1, turned to leg,3
18893,8.04E+11,7.6," down the pitch, clipped to long-on confidently to retain the strike",5
18894,8.04E+11,7.5," holds this -999 up nicely, just on middle, and bravo blocks",5
18895,8.04E+11,7.4, cute. a delicate late-cut-nudge,5
18896,8.04E+11,7.3, touch of turn back into the right hander. he punches for -999,5
18897,8.04E+11,7.2," full, wide, defended",5
18898,8.04E+11,7.1," beats him! outside off, he came forward fishily to this straighter delivery and missed it",5
18899,8.04E+11,1.6, too short and turned to square leg,15
18900,8.04E+11,1.5, wow - he's got all of this. he has utterly nailed it over wide long-on!,15
18901,8.04E+11,1.4," another attempt at pulling this into the deep and he mistimes it, but the ball lands safely between the -999 men at deep midwicket",15
18902,8.04E+11,1.3," fuller this time, charles - miles back in his crease, like lewis - waits, before stroking to leg",15
18903,8.04E+11,1.2," doesn't move his feet, disdainfully trying to smash this to leg but can't time it",15
18904,8.04E+11,1.1," huge blow over midwicket - a loopy, flighted gift and charles has murdered it",15
18905,8.04E+11,18.6," that was tough work for vandersay, but he's still standing. fierce short ball looking for his badge, he plays a pull in self-defence and the top edge does not hang in the air long enough for de kock to get under it",6
18906,8.04E+11,18.5," fast, short, on leg stump, ugly heave down towards long-on",6
18907,8.04E+11,18.4," well bowled. swaps the yorker for a slow bouncer and shanaka, who had backed -999 for the upper cut, cannot time his stroke well enough",6
18908,8.04E+11,18.3," eish, the yorker goes wrong and at that pace, shanaka only had to get an inside edge on it. gets a lot more than that. lovely flick to the long leg boundary. the fielder was up inside the circle",6
18909,8.04E+11,18.2, wanders down to third man,6
18910,8.04E+11,18.1," not when he bowls it like that though. full, fast, and straight. vandersay blocks it, and the ball pops back up at steyn. appeals for the catch off ricochet on the boot. but he was just being coy. ravi, though, was already going up to consult with his partner.",6
18911,8.04E+11,11.6," slows it down, dilshan minds it as he defends with soft hands into the covers and then he looks for a -999. can't they see faf is not the man to be playing such games with?",2
18912,8.04E+11,11.5, steered behind point again as the batsman waits on the left-arm spin,2
18913,8.04E+11,11.4, steered behind point,2
18914,8.04E+11,11.3," beaten in flight! beautifully bowled, phangiso. did he preempt it. held the ball back, and dilshan's slog sweep was nowhere near it",2
18915,8.04E+11,11.2," tossed up on off stump, driven back at him",2
18916,8.04E+11,11.1, eased into the covers as phangiso prepares to bowl -999,2
18917,8.04E+11,10.6," opens the face against a shortish ball outside off, wiese moves across to his left to get behind that",3
18918,8.04E+11,10.5," nudges it behind square leg. the middle stump, or even off stump line, has been dilshan's bread and butte rthis innings",3
18919,8.04E+11,10.4, waits on a length ball on the pads and works it through square leg,3
18920,8.04E+11,10.3, faf's having a party in the infield and sri lanka are only too happy to wander in and be suckerpunched. a length ball outside off sticks in the pitch a bit and robs jayasuriya of a pretty drive on the up. shouldn't be playing those shots so early into his innings against the older ball,3
18921,8.04E+11,10.2," fullish and just outside off, defended into the covers",3
18922,8.04E+11,10.1," full and wide outside off with the keeper standing up, slashed -999 to the sweeper cover",3
18923,8.04E+11,7.6," again, dilshan exploits the leg side field with great skill. wiese isn't the fastest of this lot, so he can be confident of working him around. the batsman shuffles across and whips a back of a length ball from seventh stump behind square leg",8
18924,8.04E+11,7.5," he is a lovely timer of the ball, but like all left-handers, he seems a bit airy outside off. pokes an angled bat -999 from his body again and gets a thick outside edge through point",8
18925,8.04E+11,7.4, leans towards a fuller ball and tucks it from outside off through midwicket. runs on offer there every time you hit it with all the men in the deep,8
18926,8.04E+11,7.3," good length ball on middle and off, defended",8
18927,8.04E+11,7.2," opens the face and finds a way to get off strike. more unintentional, because he had been looking at a gap squarer than where the ball went",8
18928,8.04E+11,7.1," lovely again. picked his spot, but before that he had picked the length. it was limp and short, milinda moves back and short-arm pulls it to the long leg boundary",8
18929,8.04E+11,4.6," and all he gets is a golden duck! what can you do? the last ball didn't turn, this pitches wide outside off and hurtles into the stumps! no magic from the pitch, just the left-arm spinner deceiving a batsman in bad form with a beauty. beautiful bowling from phangiso. tossed it up to entice the cover drive and drove through the gap to derail thirimanne",11
18930,8.04E+11,4.5," played for the turn and looks up with horror in his eyes once he heard the rattle behind him. do those new fangled stumps still rattle? phangiso is not a big spinner of the ball, certainly not when he's been hit for a couple of fours in the first -999 balls. speared it in flat, it sneaked through the gap between bat and pad as chandi went for an expansive cover drive without moving his front foot across. captain walks off with dilshan in his ear",11
18931,8.04E+11,4.4, drilled to long-off,11
18932,8.04E+11,4.3," another rush down the track, but this time phangiso adjusted well. fired it in quicker, and shorter and refused him any swinging room. dabbed towards point",11
18933,8.04E+11,4.2, more! down the track and his quick feet gets him in prime position to lift a lenght ball over long-on,11
18934,8.04E+11,4.1, and the wise old man thumps him! dilshan does not want south africa an escape route. not even a breather as he takes a simple length ball on off stump and slog sweeps it -999,11
18935,8.04E+11,2.6," back of a length and outside off, steered to deep third man",16
18936,8.04E+11,2.5, and another! gleefully presses forward at a length ball and bashes it over long-on. that's the equivalent of a bonk on the head,16
18937,8.04E+11,2.4," that's the shot of the night! 140 clicks, heavy projectile heading for your head, and chandimal was on the front foot, pushes his weight back, and hooks it for a -999!",16
18938,8.04E+11,2.3," good length ball outside off, pushed into the covers",16
18939,8.04E+11,2.2," quick and on middle and leg, dilshan was looking for his flick but didn't quite connect properly. -999 behind square leg",16
18940,8.04E+11,2.1," simple as that! he's well, half-dilscooped dale steyn. the guts need to be appreciated though, to go down face to face with the ball delivered from a speed demon. didn't time it, and most of the impact was off the thigh pad. steyn simply turned around and walked off",16
18941,8.04E+11,13.6," flatter delivery outside off, cut into the covers. looks like sri lanka are trying to push it fast and refuse any room to ab",5
18942,8.04E+11,13.5," flighted outside off, slashed to long-off",5
18943,8.04E+11,13.4," offers a short ball down leg, pulled -999 to long leg",5
18944,8.04E+11,13.3," flighted on off stump, punched past the bowler even as chandi shouts 'mili, mili, mili!' to push him over to cover the extra yard",5
18945,8.04E+11,13.2, goes back to a good length ball and pushes it to long-off,5
18946,8.04E+11,13.1," back of a length and outside off, punched through the covers",5
18947,8.04E+11,8.6, gets down the track and works a good length ball through the midwicket region,7
18948,8.04E+11,8.4," that's the captain deciding herath is too dangerous to keep bowling as he pleases. plays the shot that every spinner hates - the sweep - and it connects so well that thirimanne, who only had to move a little way to his left, misfields",7
18949,8.04E+11,8.3," played the trajectory - which was flatter - as he goes back to cut. but the ball comes on with the arm, skids on rather and had been been any slower, he would have been bowled",7
18950,8.04E+11,8.2," wanted to jump down, but herath trumped him by going flatter and on leg stump. wanders -999 off the pads",7
18951,8.04E+11,8.1, crisp drive towards mid-off. faf reached the pitch of that with a long stride,7
18952,8.04E+11,7.6," tossed up on off stump, defended to point",4
18953,8.04E+11,7.5, slashed to backward point,4
18954,8.04E+11,7.4," lovely placement from the mighty hash. he stood still, didn't make any movement to get across to a flighted ball on off stump. camped on leg, he nails a drive to the right of deep cover",4
18955,8.04E+11,7.3, plays the angle into him - and picked the right ball for the sweep because it was fullish too - -999 to short fine leg,4
18956,8.04E+11,7.2," keeps to his crease, watches the ball carefully, settles into a late cut and is suddenly at the other end",4
18957,8.04E+11,7.1," flighted in on middle, amla stays leg side of it and drives to short cover",4
18958,8.04E+11,2.6," there's the arm ball again, and even amla hasn't read it. plants the defensive bat where it would have arrived had there been any turn. inside edge to square leg",1
18959,8.04E+11,2.5," nudged behind square leg, but it hasn't travelled far enough to be any runs",1
18960,8.04E+11,2.4," good length ball on middle, defended",1
18961,8.04E+11,2.3, a whiplash from amla to reach the ball - held back a bit just outside off - and hits it to the covers,1
18962,8.04E+11,2.2, steered into the covers off a lovely long stride,1
18963,8.04E+11,2.1," that was the straighter -999, clever bowling from herath. targeting the stumps, and the ball was tossed up to disguise that. faf went to drive through the covers and instead gets the inside edge",1
18964,8.04E+11,19.6," big ole swing and a miss from mcclenaghan... and this time stokes hits at the non-striker's end, relaying the ball on from buttler. another brightly buffed final over from stokes, conceding just -999 and saving another run at the end there. so, nz put up 153 for 8. is that enough in the can for cricket's catenaccio masters?",3
18965,8.04E+11,19.5," back of a length, at the body and elliott misses with a flick to leg, stokes swoops on it like a seagull on a wotsit  but can't prevent -999",3
18966,8.04E+11,19.4," another slowie, on the stumps, whipped into the leg side for -999",3
18967,8.04E+11,19.3," slower ball outside off, swing and miss from elliott but they run anyway... stokes is tossed the ball by buttler but misses with a shy at the other end",3
18968,8.04E+11,19.2," tries to hit on the up - and sends it straight into the safe hands of jordan at long-off! third -999 for stokes, nz struggling to get -999 as england wrap them up in a chokehold. santner had the right idea, to hit inside -999, but lacked the muscle or timing",3
18969,8.04E+11,19.1," canny stuff from stokes, digs in a cutter halfway down, it spins and loops past the horizontal bat",3
18970,8.04E+11,14.6," bludgeoned, a full toss from rashid and anderson gives it a spank straight back down the ground. jordon puts in a super effort from long-off, sliding on his shirt front  to get an arm in the way, but his momentum helps carry to ball over the rope",10
18971,8.04E+11,14.5," pushed through on middle and leg, taylor works it -999 through midwicket... he's hobbling at the other end, not sure if he rolled his ankle, or what",10
18972,8.04E+11,14.4," floated up -999 the back of the hand, spinning back in, taylor blocks it toward his toes",10
18973,8.04E+11,14.3," pushed through, another googly on the legs, anderson clips it off his hip",10
18974,8.04E+11,14.2," flighted, possibly the googly, anderson gets down and swats a couple through square leg",10
18975,8.04E+11,14.1," pushed through with a flatter trajectory, taylor dinks -999 back down the ground",10
18976,8.04E+11,14.1," tossed up down the leg side, poor ball to start with",10
18977,8.04E+11,13.6," on the stumps, no width now, taylor drives down the ground to get off the mark",5
18978,8.04E+11,13.5," pitched up, full and straight, anderson backs -999 and hacks through the covers to the sweeper",5
18979,8.04E+11,13.4," on the hips, anderson stays back and nudges the ball fine, good running brings them back for -999, wasn't a great throw to buttler",5

20824,8.04E+11,9.6, gets off the mark with a steer to deep point,3
20825,8.04E+11,9.5, beaten on the drive and it creeps underneath the bat,3
20826,8.04E+11,9.4," no doubts about the credibility of this dismissal! soft dismissal, looked like the slower ball again, akmal tried to chip it over the in field and it tamely lobbed up to mahela at short midwicket, he was too early on the shot",3
20827,8.04E+11,9.3, nicely driven on the up wide of extra cover,3
20828,8.04E+11,9.2, gets off the mark with a -999 wide of mid-on,3
20829,8.04E+11,9.1," the bowling change works! mathews bowls the slower ball, the off cutter, jamshed is trapped at the crease and he half heartedly tries to tuck it -999, the umpire tucker reckoned that was hitting the off stump. but hang on - replays showed the ball pitching outside leg! well",3
20830,8.04E+11,7.6," lovely shot to end the over! hafeez made a bit of room and lofted that easily over extra cover inside -999,  bisected -999 fielders at the deep",9
20831,8.04E+11,7.5, chopped towards the off side and they take a quick -999,9
20832,8.04E+11,7.4," slogged towards wide long-on and malinga has to hurry and stop it, he fumbles and the ball nearly deflects to the rope",9
20833,8.04E+11,7.3," tries to play a late cut and the leg cutter turns and bounces and beats him, no slip in place",9
20834,8.04E+11,7.2, gets forward and safely tucks it wide of midwicket,9
20835,8.04E+11,7.1, comes forward and pushes it to the bowler with soft hands,9
20836,8.04E+11,13.6," down the -999, hogg bowls short, bravo gets a -999 to long-off",9
20837,8.04E+11,13.5," quicker lebreak, gayle waits for it, and opens the face to take a -999",9
20838,8.04E+11,13.4," tries the big drive, never mind reading the spin, gets an edge to short third man",9
20839,8.04E+11,13.3," bravo is not picking them. pushes tentatively to this full delivery, and defends it back",9
20840,8.04E+11,13.2," full, turning in, beats him in the fight, gets a dot",9
20841,8.04E+11,13.1," wrong'un but too short, and bravo goes right back into the crease to smack this for a flat -999. not too wide of deep midwicket, but you only have to miss them by a few feet if you hit so powerfully",9
20842,8.04E+11,7.6," another slower ball, defended off the front foot. top over from cummins",6
20843,8.04E+11,7.5," full and straight, defended by bravo",6

20846,8.04E+11,7.2," timbahhh. slower ball at 116ks, and the middle stump lays flat. samuels plays the odd ungainly slog this time, and is comprehensively deceived by the slower -999",6
20847,8.04E+11,7.1," no, he bowls full, and pays the price. sameuls moves half-forward, makes room by opening the front leg a bit, and then smacks it over extra cover. split seconds later, it hits the advertising boards",6
20848,8.04E+11,5.6," this was on the cards, but to the first ball he aces from regulation left-arm spin? doherty stays round the stumps to cut the angle, but he still lands it in gayle's swinging zone, and gayle sends it rows behind deep midwicket",13
20849,8.04E+11,5.5, cut -999 in front of square,13
20850,8.04E+11,5.4," samuels gets into the -999-hitting act. full, middle and leg, pretty similar to the leg-before delivery, but he has lofted it clean over long-on",13
20851,8.04E+11,5.3," short, gets a bottom edge on the cut",13
20852,8.04E+11,5.2," samuels is lucky again. this was dead plumb. umpire dar has had a slip. this is full, pitches middle, straightens, and is missing both the leg and off stumps. samuels has got -999 with -999 here",13
20853,8.04E+11,5.1, and edge first up. samuels is lucky it has not carries to slip as he opens the face,13
20854,8.04E+11,4.6, back and played into the leg side for a -999 past point,3
20855,8.04E+11,4.5, forward and blocking into the leg side,3
20856,8.04E+11,4.4," first ball tries to pull, it's nowhere near short enough to pull and goes under the stroke and thankfully for the batsman past off stump",3
20857,8.04E+11,4.3," goes for the shame stroke, again it skips on but this is straight and -999 goes leg stump. right call to keep badree going because he's slid -999 past the big man. that is a massive, massive blow. it was dragged down but skidded on to watson and he was too late with the stroke",3
20858,8.04E+11,4.2," steps back quickly to pull hard but misses, skipped on a touched quicker",3
20859,8.04E+11,4.1," leg stump and full, played into the on side for just a -999",3
20860,8.04E+11,3.6," step back to cut and slaps it past extra cover, super timing, it was just fractionally short and watson was on to it in a flash",6

20864,8.04E+11,3.2," bit of turn here, played off the hip towards short long leg from a length",6
20865,8.04E+11,3.1," oh swept straight up in the air and taken by the bowler in typically nonplussed fashion. kicks the ball -999, is that how -999 celebrates getting rid of hussey in a semi-final? it is if you're marlon samuels. it was just outside off and hussey swung hard at it aiming over the leg side but got it off a huge top edge and it went nowhere",6
20866,8.04E+11,0.6," back and it skips past the cut stroke and narrowly avoids off stump, ramdin had the bails off and they're going the check for the stumping, surely warner didn't leave his ground here...oh it's not for the stumping it's bowled him! who would have thought that, it nicked the off stump on the way through to the keeper and has bowled warner. what a blow for west indies, another great start from badree",2
20867,8.04E+11,0.5," back once more, cut hard but charles dives a cover point and saves -999, fine save, good work",2

20875,8.04E+11,18.3," full ball again, swung to leg, gets it off the edge to short long leg",10
20876,8.04E+11,18.2," another great yorker, dug -999 and it flies to long leg for -999, very lucky but more runs off malinga",10
20877,8.04E+11,18.1," good full ball, samuels would have hit that for -999 but ramdin got in a fuss outside it and could only drive it through the covers",10
20878,8.04E+11,13.6," forward around off stump, big cry for leg before, was it pad first? yes says the umpire and bravo has to go. he was caught around the knee roll playing forward around off stump, -999 had doubt of whether he was in line and especially whether there was bat involved but umpire taufel thought both favoured the bowler and that it wasn't too high either, another big blow",4
20879,8.04E+11,13.5," outside off again, dropped into cover point for a -999",4
20880,8.04E+11,13.4," outside off, went to fiddle it fine and missed",4

20887,8.04E+11,11.3, offspinner blocked forward around the off stump,10
20888,8.04E+11,11.2," finally a big shot, swung -999 from a full length on the stumps, gets it over midwicket, was a googly but bravo took it full enough and timed it perfectly",10

20898,8.04E+11,8.4," smashed, malinga does well at deep cover, diving to his right, remember he dropped hafeez in the semi, this time he throws himself to his right against that well-struck drive on the up and keeps them to -999 runs",7
20899,8.04E+11,8.3," shortish outside off, cuts it wide of third man but good fielding from dananjaya at third man, returned a good throw to keep them to a -999",7

20904,8.04E+11,5.5," gayle's trapped in front, this went straight on, gayle was caught in front again, rocked forward but not much to defend but played a little outside the line to that, struck him in line with middle and leg and taufel had no doubt this time, was flatter and straighter this time",2
20905,8.04E+11,5.4," gayle tries to sweep that shortish delivery down leg, caught on the glove, it pops up in front of short fine, lands safe",2
20906,8.04E+11,5.3," the legspinner again, shortish on leg stump and turning down, quicker through the air this time and gayle is struck on the pads as he tries to whip it square, big appeal for lbw, was missing leg, replays show that would have hit leg, so my bad.",2

20916,8.04E+11,0.6," maiden to start with, ideal stuff for sri lanka, in the channel outside off, wider than the deliveries before this, leaves it be",0
20917,8.04E+11,0.5," west indies have lost charles! short and he went after it, made a bit of room and tried to slap it back over the bowler's head but totally mistimed, lobbed up towards mid-off and was an easy catch in the end",0

20922,8.04E+11,18.4," that's it, west indies are the world twenty20 champions. malinga slogs the ball high towards long-on, where bravo settles under the catch and sprints towards his team-mates. there's gangnam all over the outfield, ramdin is cartwheeling, sort of, west indies are champions! there's going to be such a party in their hotel tonight",0

21771,8.04E+11,9.3, but he is gone now. he was lured by the flight and moved down the track but the ball was slower than he thought and dipped on him quickly. he had to wait a touch for it to arrive but could only hit it straight to long-on,6

22100,8.04E+11,0.4, whoa whoa! no -999 is ready to wait! asif serves up a statement of intent as he launches into this flighted delivery and sends this as high as long.. it lands close to the sight screen. wonderful strike,11

22112,8.04E+11,8.4," dropped at mid-off! an opportunity goes to waste! the batsman saw the fuller length and looked to drive it over the infield, but it was a slower delivery and he didn't get hold of it. all the fielder had to do is to backpedal early enough. he is late and despite getting a hand to it never looked in control",9
22113,8.04E+11,8.3," length delivery on the stumps, it's punched to long on",9
22114,8.04E+11,8.2," another nippy delivery, this -999 is short and although it looses pace after bouncing, it does surprise the batsman, who gets -999 of the way in time",9

22125,8.04E+11,1.3," flighted and slow, it's on the pads and the batsman goes for a sweep, but is not able to beat the short fine leg fielder. a misfield allows a  -999",5

22129,8.04E+11,11.5," there is an appeal for stumping as barkat plays inside the line of a fuller delivery! shahzad takes the bails in a flash. the third umpire is checking this but this could be a no-ball.. very close for nabi. -999 think he should he ok, although very tight. barkat should be safe too, he dragged his back foot well in time",10
22130,8.04E+11,11.4," he comes down the pitch and this -999 is beautifully hit over extra cover! again, no power, just pure timing.  the ball was not full enough so even more points for that control in that shot",10

22143,8.04E+11,3.3, he means business! this is full outside off and it's clobbered over the non-striker's head for a -999-bounce -999. atkinson is fast erasing the memories of that first-ball loss,16

22145,8.04E+11,3.2," yes, this is exactly like kp! he chooses to stay in the crease and hammers the short delivery over midwicket with a murderous pull. he actually made the bowler bowl that short delivery. wonderful. imperious",16

22317,8.04E+11,11.2, fuller delivery and he makes room and drills it down to long-off,11
22318,8.04E+11,11.1, this -999 skidded through and he made a hint of room and dabbed it towards point,11
22319,8.04E+11,7.6, flatter -999 and he flicks it to square leg,15
22320,8.04E+11,7.5, comes forward and drives to mid-off,15
22321,8.04E+11,7.4," this time joyce comes down the track and gets to the pitch of it and chips it wide of long-on, good placement",15
22322,8.04E+11,7.3," flat -999! there were cries of 'catch it' after the ball sped off the bat but the fielder at deep midwicket could only watch, tossed up and he gets on his knee and slogs, clean hit",15
22323,8.04E+11,7.2, stays back and punches it to the off side,15
22324,8.04E+11,7.1," porterfield looks to play the reverse sweep, the ball hits his pad, there's an appeal but the ball pitched outside leg",15
22325,8.04E+11,0.6," this was pitched up outside off and he gets forward and scoops it over cover, it was too wide outside off",10
22326,8.04E+11,0.5, bowls it on the stumps and he checks his shot,10
22327,8.04E+11,0.4," shorter and he defends this high on the bat, porterfield runs and heads back",10
22328,8.04E+11,0.3," awesome back foot punch, this was a length ball, moved -999 and he had the room to stand tall and punch it wide of point and cover, stand and deliver",10
22329,8.04E+11,0.3," he drifts wide down the leg side, looks to tuck it -999",10
22330,8.04E+11,0.2," that hurried on to him, he was too early on the pull and the ball struck his elbow and dropped to the off side",10
22331,8.04E+11,0.1, good length on middle and off and tucked to the on side,10
22332,8.04E+11,18.6, they will take whatever brings them some runs! the batsman looks to swing this length delivery across the line but gets a thick inside edge down to fine leg,6
22333,8.04E+11,18.5," slower delivery on the pads, the batsman looks to heave it to the leg side, but misses it and gets hit on the pads",6
22334,8.04E+11,18.4," another -999 goes down! or does it! it is a quick short delivery that flies past the outside edge to the keeper, who goes up immediately. shapoor joins in a little later but aleem dar is unmoved..",6
22335,8.04E+11,18.3," another -999 down! shapoor got taken for runs off the fuller -999, but his short delivery does the job. the batsman veers -999 to the leg side to smash it over the off, but gets a thick top edge that lobs up for the keeper",6
22336,8.04E+11,18.2," murdered down the ground! wow, what a shot this -999 is! it was an attempted yorker gone wrong, but the batsman finds enough space to get under it hammer it over the umpire's head..",6
22337,8.04E+11,18.1, that is the end of khakurel's fantastic effort! he looks to heave the length delivery to the deep midwicket boundary but gets more height than length on that.. ashgar stanikzai does very well to run back from midwicket and grab that comfortably in the end,6
22338,8.04E+11,16.6," another boundary! well done khakurel, who gets to his half-century, with a sliced boundary through backward point. the floodgates have opened for nepal.",12
22339,8.04E+11,16.5," another attempted slower ball, but this is a full toss that the batsman drags straight to midwicket! could have gone anywhere really. but he is also struggling to complete the run here. just makes it in time, the replays show",12
22340,8.04E+11,16.4," this -999 is a good slower ball, right in the block hole. the batsman does well to jam it -999 back down the pitch",12
22341,8.04E+11,16.3," another slower delivery, this time the batsman squeezes it down to third man",12
22342,8.04E+11,16.2, the mid-off fielder is up and nepal take advantage! this was a slightly slower ball but the batsman spotted that and lifts it over the infield. it just beats the mid-off fielder but this outfield is quick enough to take it to the boundary,12
22343,8.04E+11,16.1, he makes room and slices the short of length delivery over point for another couple of runs,12
22344,8.04E+11,14.6," fuller delivery outside off, the batsman drives it back to the bowler",16
22345,8.04E+11,14.6," quicker delivery outside off, it should have been hit. but this -999 is outside the wide marker. nepal wouldn't mind",16
22346,8.04E+11,14.5, this -999 is fortunate! he gets a thick outside edge that just evades the diving gully fielder and runs down the boundary,16
22347,8.04E+11,14.4, finally -999 ends up over the boundary! he moves across to the off side and gets a short ball to boot. he whacks it really hard over the short fine leg fielder and that goes all the way,16
22348,8.04E+11,14.3," again, tries to hard to whack it down the ground, but only hits it straight to long on",16
22349,8.04E+11,14.2," high full toss outside off, the batsman misses -999 on some free runs as he gets a thick outside edge to short third man.. he was looking to hit it through cover",16
22350,8.04E+11,14.1," flatter outside off, there is no turn so the batsman manages to chip it over extra cover for a couple of runs",16
22351,8.04E+11,14.1," tossed up and it's almost a yorker, the batsman digs it -999 back to shenwari",16
22352,8.04E+11,5.6, this is massive! it hits the boundary boards over long-on! what an over for nepal! malla somehow was expecting this to be tossed up. he just stretches -999 and thwacks it over long-on,18
22353,8.04E+11,5.5," forces the bowler to shorten his length, then whacks it over mid-on with a horizontal bat. good thinking there by malla",18
22354,8.04E+11,5.4," wow! he is keen to find that extra cover boundary. this -999 is over the field, only just though. but this is well hit, as he went along with the spin",18
22355,8.04E+11,5.3, creates room and punches this to extra cover..too many fielders there now after that first boundary. five in all,18
22356,8.04E+11,5.2, this is a poor shot! he looks to hoick the flatter delivery agains the spin and gets completly beaten,18
22357,8.04E+11,5.1, beautifully driven through extra cover! the infield is crowded but malla takes advantage of a full and flighted delivery by driving it expertly through the gap,18
22358,8.04E+11,19.6, it's a play and a miss and it gives nepal a wonderful win against arch-rivals afghanistan - their first against the opposition in t20s,14
22359,8.04E+11,19.5," malla, at long on, corrects his last -999 mistakes and finally takes a catch. it's a simple chance for the fielder as stanikzai lofts the full toss straight down the ground. that shot lacked punch. that's also the end of line for afghanistan",14
22360,8.04E+11,19.4, this -999 is brilliantly hit in the same gap at wide long on! the batsman waits on the back foot and pulls it right in the gap this time.. no chance for that fielder from long on to cut this off,14
22361,8.04E+11,19.3, swings it across the line and gets an inside edge to midwicket and they come back for the second,14
22362,8.04E+11,19.2," this is stupid from the fielder! he gets a redemption chance as the batsman repeats the shot - it's almost an action replay. all the fielder has to do is watch the bounce and exactly like the previous delivery, he is not able to keep it in",14
22363,8.04E+11,19.1," length delivery on the legs, the batsman heaves it to wide long on where the fielder lets it go through his hands. that should have been stopped",14
22364,8.04E+11,16.6, lovely yorker! this -999 misses everything. the batsman heaved at it but it slipped under the bat and somehow missed the off stump too,7
22365,8.04E+11,16.5," another good yorker, not much you can do about those. the batsman digs it -999 to mid on",7
22366,8.04E+11,16.4," this -999 just beats regmi at backward point! it was another good delivery on off, the batsman ended up slicing it behind point.. and regmi, if he was -999 inches taller, would have got this -999 easily. -999 fielder converge near the boundary and manage to keep it in",7
22367,8.04E+11,16.3," another -999 right at the base of the stumps, not much room to get under it. but asghar hits it firmly down to long off and comes back for a second as the fielder was touch slow",7
22368,8.04E+11,16.2," another good delivery! it's full and it's headed on the middle, the batsman punches it down to long on for a -999",7
22369,8.04E+11,16.1," what a good yorker that is! nothing much the batsman could do with it, he digs it -999 back down the pitch",7
22370,8.04E+11,13.6, a good over this -999! he bowls a quicker delivery that is defended back to the bowler.,3

22377,8.04E+11,10.5," flatter this time, the batsman has to wait and can only clip it to short fine leg",8
22378,8.04E+11,10.4, what a strike! stanikzai gets under it proper and slams it over long on! that is a biggie.. it sails over and over and over the boundary..,8
22379,8.04E+11,10.3, he bends down and sweeps this nicely down to deep backward square leg for a couple,8
22380,8.04E+11,10.2, good work from the bowler who runs to his right and dives to cut off the batsman's push towards mid-on,8

23430,8.04E+11,4.6," both gayle and the wicketkeeper, taylor missed that -999. gayle misses his pull and taylor gets a bad bounce",5
23431,8.04E+11,4.5," on the off, pushed to mid-off",5
23432,8.04E+11,4.4," fullish on the off, driven on-the-up to mid-off",5
23433,8.04E+11,4.3, again the bottom-hand comes into play and kills the power. the ball rolls to cover,5
23434,8.04E+11,4.2, gayle attempts to break free with a forcing thump but couldn't get much power behind that stroke and the point fielder moves to his left to make the stop,5
23435,8.04E+11,4.1," on the legs, tucked behind square-leg",5
23436,8.04E+11,49.6," atapattu tries a scoop and misses, while taylor misses the stumps - the batsman would have been well -999 and they get a -999 from the final ball",6
23437,8.04E+11,49.5, lashed to mid-on,6
23438,8.04E+11,49.4, square-driven on -999 knee,6
23439,8.04E+11,49.3, helped into midwicket,6
23440,8.04E+11,49.2, swung -999 over extra cover for -999,6
23441,8.04E+11,49.1," well bowled, just outside off, with a hint of inswing, and there's a swoosh at that -999",6
23442,8.04E+11,44.6, the ball hardly gets up as it goes wide and that's slashed to the off-side to bring up the 250,7
23443,8.04E+11,44.5, guided to third man,7
23444,8.04E+11,44.4, a nudge into the off-side this time,7
23445,8.04E+11,44.3," better ball, fuller, and the batsman gets over that -999 to defend",7
23446,8.04E+11,44.2," drops short and wide; that's well played after the batsman waited a long time to play that -999, climbing into a lovely cut through the covers",7
23447,8.04E+11,44.1, smothered that -999,7
23448,8.04E+11,42.6, another good ball to finish utseya's spell,1
23449,8.04E+11,42.5, a quick -999 this time,1
23450,8.04E+11,42.4, over the ball again and that's defended this time,1
23451,8.04E+11,42.3, got over the ball and eased that to midwicket,1
23452,8.04E+11,42.2," ooh, close call. the batsman offered no shot to a topspinner, an odd ball to leave alone as it pitched on the stumps",1
23453,8.04E+11,42.1," a bit of a soft dismissal. the batsman tried to paddle that, got a bit of a top edge and that's straight down's kamungozi's throat at square leg, and the fielder makes no mistake. that's another blip in sri lanka's progress",1
23454,8.04E+11,30.6, looked for a -999 into the covers but sent back,12
23455,8.04E+11,30.5, charges the bowler and crunches the ball through cover with a glorious drive,12
23456,8.04E+11,30.5," another no ball from the offspinner, spinners should never overstep",12
23457,8.04E+11,30.4, dabbed into the covers,12
23458,8.04E+11,30.3," danced down the pitch, thumped to long on and well fielded",12
23459,8.04E+11,30.2, short and hammered through the covers,12
23460,8.04E+11,30.1," down the track, inside -999 over cover, a cracking shot",12
23461,8.04E+11,29.6, uses his feet to fly the ball over to deep midwicket,2
23462,8.04E+11,29.5, drops that -999 short and the ball is worked down to ireland in the deep,2
23463,8.04E+11,29.4, gets over the ball and kamungozi does well in the field this time,2
23464,8.04E+11,29.3, that's well picked up again in the field at short mid--999,2
23465,8.04E+11,29.2, fails to get hold of a sweep and the ball flies between the batsman's legs,2
23466,8.04E+11,29.1, thought of a quick -999 but it was never on as the fielder rushed in from short midwicket,2
23467,8.04E+11,21.6, hit to cover,3
23468,8.04E+11,21.5, looped in and defended again,3
23469,8.04E+11,21.4, well pitched up and smothered this time,3
23470,8.04E+11,21.3, pushed -999 to cover,3
23471,8.04E+11,21.2, drops on a good length and that's worked into mid--999,3
23472,8.04E+11,21.1, that drops just a touch wide and that's pushed -999 behind point,3
23473,8.04E+11,12.6, the second boundary off the over goes racing through point and tharanga is starting to look dangerous,8
23474,8.04E+11,12.5, short again but the batsman finds the fielder at point,8
23475,8.04E+11,12.4, punched to mid on,8
23476,8.04E+11,12.3, he finds the middle of the bat with this -999 and sends it racing through the covers as chigumbura drops fractionally short and wide,8
23477,8.04E+11,12.2, outside off stump and tharanga has a flash but doesn't connect,8
23478,8.04E+11,12.1, on the mark first up as tharanga defends,8
23479,8.04E+11,4.6, played a defensive -999 off the back foot to round off another tidy over,4
23480,8.04E+11,4.5," ooh, that -999 pitched in line and there was an appeal. that pitched in line but height may have been a factor in the call being turned down, as was the possible inside edge",4
23481,8.04E+11,4.4," banged in by the bowler with a scrambled seam, but that's defended quite easily  in the end",4
23482,8.04E+11,4.3," sends that -999 aerial, but just short of chigumbura at point, and the few supporters in the ground cheer loudly at the temporary excitement",4
23483,8.04E+11,4.2," didn't time that -999 properly, an inside edge flies through to the mid--999 area",4
23484,8.04E+11,4.2," just overstepped with a little extra effort there and the batsman doesn't quite manage to get hold of the ball, chopping it into the ground",4
23485,8.04E+11,4.1," a good delivery but the batsman works that cleverly to leg, with a mere press, where they batsmen scramble a -999 as there is no fielder at square leg; indeed there are seven men on the off-side for jayasuriya",4
23486,8.04E+11,2.6," tidy end to the over, there, with a decent delivery that's defended once more",5
23487,8.04E+11,2.6," that -999 strays down leg and the keeper misses that -999 again, too, the ball rolling behind him",5
23488,8.04E+11,2.5, right on the money and tharanga can only defend that -999 down,5
23489,8.04E+11,2.4," punched nicely through point but chigumbura chases that down well, just inside the boundary and the batsmen run -999",5
23490,8.04E+11,2.3," that -999 strays down leg and the batsman chases it round; there was a noise but it came off the thigh pad, as it was taylor fluffed any potential catch",5
23491,8.04E+11,2.2," defended into covers, another decent delivery",5
23492,8.04E+11,2.1," the batsman plays that fairly lateish, readjusting his thoughts as the ball pitches straight rears slightly and he fends that -999 down on the back foot",5
23493,8.04E+11,42.3," finally malinga gets -999 straight and mupariwa misses a wild heave to bring this match to an end. the result has been known for much of zimbabwe's innings but the sri lankan bowlers will be pleased with their run -999, although there were a few too many extras once again",4
23494,8.04E+11,42.2," hold onto your hats folks, it's a boundary! a thick edge flies over the slips and down to third man",4
23495,8.04E+11,42.1," tries to give himself room again, doesn't time the ball and goes to mid off",4
23496,8.04E+11,40.6," attempted yorker, hits the boot but drifting down the leg side",2
23497,8.04E+11,40.5, inswinger and defended from the crease,2
23498,8.04E+11,40.4, outside off stump and left to the keeper,2
23499,8.04E+11,40.3, gets bat onto this -999 and they scamper a -999,2
23500,8.04E+11,40.3, very wide outside off stump,2
23501,8.04E+11,40.2, strikes the pads but going well down the leg side,2
23502,8.04E+11,40.1," short, on the off stump and zips past the edge",2
23503,8.04E+11,39.6, and that's defended to end the over,0
23504,8.04E+11,39.5, how did that miss? it just went through straight,0
23505,8.04E+11,39.4," there was some bat on that -999, but that just evades the man in short on the off-side",0
23506,8.04E+11,39.3, that pops up a little bit,0
23507,8.04E+11,39.2," another doosra and that's comprehensively beaten the batsman who was looking for the off-break, but it went the other way, just rubbing the outside edge and sangakkara does the rest",0
23508,8.04E+11,39.1," a half-cry, trying to slide that -999 through the gate",0
23509,8.04E+11,33.6," a looser -999 and the batsman tries to sweep, but just misses -999",3
23510,8.04E+11,33.5, comes around the -999 to change the angle but the batsman is able to work that off his hips and -999 for a -999,3
23511,8.04E+11,33.4," ah, back to defence again - this is great containing bowling by sri lanka",3
23512,8.04E+11,33.3," a run! -999, even! that's worked into the covers and the batsmen jog through",3
23513,8.04E+11,33.2, defended once again,3
23514,8.04E+11,33.1," more defence, this time forced by murali",3
23515,8.04E+11,24.6, guided -999 to point and the end of another tight over from fernando,1
23516,8.04E+11,24.5, another very full ball which is squeezed -999 onto the off side,1
23517,8.04E+11,24.4, outside edge down to third man where maharoof cleans up,1
23518,8.04E+11,24.3, attempted yorker but the batsman gets down on it and forces the ball back to the bowler,1
23519,8.04E+11,24.2, outside off stump and left to the keeper,1
23520,8.04E+11,24.1, the short-pitched attack continues as mupariwa takes -999 in the body,1
23521,8.04E+11,46.3," the innings ends with a diving catch. rasel aimed to clip the ball to leg but only got a leading edge which lobbed high into the covers. it was probably lara's catch but there was a marked lack of calling and in the end samuels races in from backward point, diving  forward full length to catch the ball a foot off the ground",0
23522,8.04E+11,46.2, again rasel spars at the ball and misses,0
23523,8.04E+11,46.1, up in the blockhole and squeezed -999,0
23524,8.04E+11,44.6, fittingly bravo finishes his spell by beating rasel's slashing drive,2
23525,8.04E+11,44.5, another ball roars past rasel's outside edge,2
23526,8.04E+11,44.4, slightly too full and driven up to long off,2
23527,8.04E+11,44.3, rasel connects!  an outside edge goes through fourth slip for a -999,2
23528,8.04E+11,44.2," and another -999 flies past the edge, but it keeps low and any snick would have fallen short",2
23529,8.04E+11,44.1," bravo has now beaten rasel's outside edge -999 times in succession, and rasel doesn't look like getting near it",2
23530,8.04E+11,42.6, much the same but half a yard quicker ... and rasel even further from making contact,1
23531,8.04E+11,42.5, rasel prodded at that with no footwork and it beat his outside edge with something to spare,1
23532,8.04E+11,42.4, placed between the cover fielders for a -999 to the man in the deep. that's the first run bravo has conceded in front of square,1
23533,8.04E+11,42.3," into the covers, not a sniff of a run",1
23534,8.04E+11,42.2," marginally short of a length, mashud drops his hands and thrusts -999 his chest as the ball flies past his midriff",1
23535,8.04E+11,42.1, too quick for mashud. hits him on the body and squirts -999 on the leg,1
23536,8.04E+11,32.6," wider this time, and again no stroke offered. solid stuff from bravo",1
23537,8.04E+11,32.5," full length, right on off stump, uneasy steer to point",1
23538,8.04E+11,32.4," outside off, left well alone",1
23539,8.04E+11,32.3, more tight lines from bravo - he's bowled very well indeed,1
23540,8.04E+11,32.2," on the back foot, and steered to point",1
23541,8.04E+11,32.1, a bit chancy there - an inside-edge eludes the stumps and results in a scampered -999,1
23542,8.04E+11,28.6, another dot ball to end a tight over,1
23543,8.04E+11,28.5, placed to the left of point for an easy -999,1
23544,8.04E+11,28.4," slightly straighter, driven to mid off",1
23545,8.04E+11,28.3, a pattern emerging here ... bravo bowling a steady line and the off-side field doing the rest,1
23546,8.04E+11,28.2, guided to extra cover,1
23547,8.04E+11,28.1, took his bottom hand off the bat and it plopped into the leg side,1
23548,8.04E+11,27.6, this time it's played finer and that allowed the run,6
23549,8.04E+11,27.5, same again. samuels proving hard to get -999,6
23550,8.04E+11,27.4, pushed square to point,6
23551,8.04E+11,27.3, patted back to the bowler,6
23552,8.04E+11,27.2, worked to leg,6
23553,8.04E+11,27.1, delicately steered wide of slip and to the boundary,6
23554,8.04E+11,24.6, driven in the air off the back foot but into a big gap and the man at deep cover keeps them down to a -999,3
23555,8.04E+11,24.5, squirted behind square on the leg,3
23556,8.04E+11,24.4, nothing doing again. a tight field is putting pressure on,3
23557,8.04E+11,24.3, opened the face and tried to run into space on the off,3
23558,8.04E+11,24.2," dropped!  extra bounce, an outside edge and baugh diving to his right gets a glove to it but spills it. there is a suspicion that he should have tried to get his other hand to it",3
23559,8.04E+11,24.1, farhad driven on to the back foot by an extra yard of pace,3
23560,8.04E+11,20.6, a foot or so outside off stump but with the way this over has gone farhad is not going to try anything daft,2
23561,8.04E+11,20.5, back on line and flat-batted to mid on,2
23562,8.04E+11,20.5, er ... a bouncer wide down the leg side with the hat-trick ball. not really the most intelligent bowling,2
23563,8.04E+11,20.4," a first-baller to follow his second baller at the weekend. habibul only half forward and with the bat lurking behind his front pad, not much doubt that that was going on to remove his middle stump. in the space of -999 balls bangladesh have gone from looking comfortable to being in the mire",2
23564,8.04E+11,20.3," lazy footwork from hasan, inside edge attempting a loose drive and the balls cannons into his off stump. 'that's ****,' splutters the father of bangladesh cricket. he has a point",2
23565,8.04E+11,20.2," lovely line,  considered playing but withdrew at the last second",2
23566,8.04E+11,20.1, clipped to leg for a strolled -999,2
23567,8.04E+11,29.6, once more long on is called into action,2
23568,8.04E+11,29.5, gayle treats that with respect,2
23569,8.04E+11,29.4, punched to long on,2
23570,8.04E+11,29.3, a bit more aggression as the ball is cracked to extra cover,2
23571,8.04E+11,29.2, blocked again. no need to do anything else at this stage,2
23572,8.04E+11,29.1, blocked,2
23573,8.04E+11,27.6," a decent first over, but not really threatening",1
23574,8.04E+11,27.5, too short and worked to leg. gayle a bit surprised by some extra llft and he ended up playing that with just his top hand,1
23575,8.04E+11,27.4, gayle content to see if hasan has anything up his sleeve,1
23576,8.04E+11,27.2, again there or thereabouts,1
23577,8.04E+11,27.1," accurate start, on the spot",1
23578,8.04E+11,17.6, guided behind square on the off but once more to the fielder,2
23579,8.04E+11,17.4," neat line, no chance of a run",2
23580,8.04E+11,17.3," driven straight, razzak doesn't gather it cleanly and the batsmen canter for a -999",2
23581,8.04E+11,17.2, steered square on the leg side,2
23582,8.04E+11,17.1, chanderpaul played for spin that wasn't there and was left groping at air,2
23583,8.04E+11,10.6, tight line to finish and stoutly defended back down the pitch,6
23584,8.04E+11,10.5," square-drive, fielded at point",6
23585,8.04E+11,10.4, another couple to the total,6
23586,8.04E+11,10.3," beauty! perfect line, length and seam movement, beat everything",6
23587,8.04E+11,10.2," too wide this time, and clattered through point - lovely stroke!",6
23588,8.04E+11,10.1," good line and length, seams past the bat",6
23589,8.04E+11,2.6," short and outside off stump, no stroke offered",1
23590,8.04E+11,2.5, escapes the strike with a dab behind square,1
23591,8.04E+11,2.4, jabs down late on a -999-to--999 delivery. would have been stone-dead but for the massive inside-edge that stifles the appeal,1
23592,8.04E+11,2.3, squeezed into the leg side,1
23593,8.04E+11,2.2," definitely kept lower this time, and gayle is looking a bit uncomfortable in these early exchanges",1
23594,8.04E+11,2.1," good bowling, short of a length and tight to the stumps, just eludes gayle's edge",1
23595,8.04E+11,48.6," that's the shot patented by andrew strauss, steps across his stumps and flicks it to fine leg but can only chip it short of ireland",5
23596,8.04E+11,48.5, slow -999 again and swung to deep midwicket,5
23597,8.04E+11,48.4, full and whacked at point who can't quite gather cleanly,5
23598,8.04E+11,48.3, swing and a miss and catches the keeper on the arm,5
23599,8.04E+11,48.2," a tired swipe from nafees who chips it to a mid off who's deep, he scrambles forward, leaps and puts down a tough chance - chibhabha is the fielder",5
23600,8.04E+11,48.1," good change of pace, but the batsman gives himself room",5
23601,8.04E+11,42.6, strong hit over mid on and -999 bounce into the crowd,6
23602,8.04E+11,42.5," low full toss, hit to deep square takes him to 99",6
23603,8.04E+11,42.4, hits the fielder at cover,6
23604,8.04E+11,42.3, watchfully played to midwicket,6
23605,8.04E+11,42.2, full outside off driven to third man,6
23606,8.04E+11,42.1," in the block hole, pace man back and doing the stuff straight -999",6
23607,8.04E+11,40.6," follows this with a glorious, full swinging drive finding the gap at mid off, nafees really accelerating now",12
23608,8.04E+11,40.4, down the -999 and big swing over the legside for the first -999 of the innings,12
23609,8.04E+11,40.2, driven to mid off and easy -999,12
23610,8.04E+11,40.1, blocked to mid on,12
23611,8.04E+11,30.6, defended forward,2
23612,8.04E+11,30.5, waits for the ball and hits into midwicket off the back foot,2
23613,8.04E+11,30.4, swept to deep square leg,2
23614,8.04E+11,30.3," stays on his backfoot, a leaden-footed attempt to drive",2
23615,8.04E+11,30.2, easily driven forward without much power,2
23616,8.04E+11,30.1, defended on the front foot,2
23617,8.04E+11,29.6, played -999 to the on side,4
23618,8.04E+11,29.5, played back to the bowler,4
23619,8.04E+11,29.4, that's the first run of the tournament for bashar,4
23620,8.04E+11,29.3," brilliant catch, went back to give himself room to cut but the ball bounced a little more than he expected on this slow pitch and he couldn't keep it down. rainsford flung himself to his left at backward point and held the chance inches off the turf. big -999 for zimbabwe",4
23621,8.04E+11,29.2, struck down to long on and the fielder keeps them to a -999,4
23622,8.04E+11,29.2, down the leg side and signalled by umpire bucknor,4
23623,8.04E+11,29.1, swept -999 to backward square-leg,4
23624,8.04E+11,27.6, another well-taken -999 into the off side,4
23625,8.04E+11,27.5, can't beat the on-side field,4

23629,8.04E+11,27.1, bangladesh reach -999 figures with a chip to long off,4
23630,8.04E+11,24.6," same shot, same result as utseya finds his line again",7
23631,8.04E+11,24.5," on the front foot, played -999 to cover",7
23632,8.04E+11,24.4," too short and nafees rocks back and finds the gap between short third man and point, the ball races across the outfield to the fence",7

23634,8.04E+11,24.2, picks the gap at extra cover this time and there is time to complete a brace,7

23636,8.04E+11,19.6, driven to long on,6

23638,8.04E+11,19.4," thrashed at cover, bengalis looking frustrated still",6
23639,8.04E+11,19.3," swinging hard but failing to time it, this is a tough pitch to play these shots",6
23640,8.04E+11,19.2," frustration now, dances down the -999, swings, wraps him on the pad and they scramble through for a run",6
23641,8.04E+11,19.1, straight and played to mid off,6
23642,8.04E+11,17.6," carefully watched and carefully played to cover - gritty, old-fashioned cricket",1
23643,8.04E+11,17.5," plays and misses outside off stump, some bounce for the first time which surprises everyone",1
23644,8.04E+11,17.4, this time he finds the gap and takes the -999,1
23645,8.04E+11,17.3, dropped straight to mid off,1
23646,8.04E+11,17.2," width, throws everything at it and cover dives full length making a great stop",1

23651,8.04E+11,11.4, guided to gully,5
23652,8.04E+11,11.3, too much width and nafees climbs into a great cut behind square,5
23653,8.04E+11,11.2, wide once more and taylor takes,5
23654,8.04E+11,11.1," jabs bat down on a length ball that keeps low, this is a slow, tough -999 to play shots on",5
23655,8.04E+11,2.5, that -999 swung -999 from the righthander who slashed at it with an ugly swish,7
23656,8.04E+11,2.5," very wide down the off-side, but the batsman had a bit of a head-rush and chased it with his bat, but it was too wide to reach",7
23657,8.04E+11,2.4," and more runs the very next ball! struck more fluently this time, a lovely, balanced cover-drive which he threw his hands at, and that evades the diving fielder at cover and races -999",7
23658,8.04E+11,2.3," runs at last! and they're cheered loudly by the crowd. good hands, pushing that in front of square and that's his 1000th run in -999-dayers. well done that man",7
23659,8.04E+11,2.2, left alone as that -999 sails down the off-side channel,7
23660,8.04E+11,2.1, the batsman steers that -999 -999 to cover where it's tidily picked up and bangladesh are still searching for their first run,7
23661,8.04E+11,38.6," sorry, -999've run -999 of ways to describe a -999...so it's a -999 into the on side",3
23662,8.04E+11,38.5, and they'll worry even less about the scoreless deliveries,3
23663,8.04E+11,38.4, long off again in action but bangladesh won't worry about the ones,3
23664,8.04E+11,38.3, bit more flight from rafique and brent misses his cut shot,3
23665,8.04E+11,38.2, down to long on,3
23666,8.04E+11,35.6," tries to sweep, misses and is taken on the pad well outside the line of the off stump. saqibul's fine spell continues",1
23667,8.04E+11,35.5, comes forward but can only block it down the pitch,1
23668,8.04E+11,35.4, back to the bowler,1
23669,8.04E+11,35.3, this time he hits it with enough power to get the ball down the ground to long on,1
23670,8.04E+11,35.2, can't break the field as mid on collects,1
23671,8.04E+11,35.1, straight ball played -999 into the on side,1

23675,8.04E+11,25.3, trying to use his feet but he's finding it hard to get -999,1
23676,8.04E+11,25.2, driven down to mid on and they trot through,1
23677,8.04E+11,25.1, blocked and the bowler fields,1
23678,8.04E+11,24.6, driven into the covers but finds the gap,3
23679,8.04E+11,24.3, mid off kept busy again after a nice drive,3
23680,8.04E+11,24.2, loud appeal for ball slipping down the leg,3
23681,8.04E+11,19.6, nicely struck; just waited for the ball to come to him a fraction longer and that's guided into midwicket,5
23682,8.04E+11,19.5, defended on the front foot this time,5
23683,8.04E+11,19.4, defended into the covers,5
23684,8.04E+11,19.3, defended again,5
23685,8.04E+11,19.2, big leading edge against the spin balloons up and lands in space at long-on,5
23686,8.04E+11,19.1, speared up in the blockhole and that's defended once more; the squeeze is really on zimbabwe now,5
23687,8.04E+11,18.6, defended once more,1
23688,8.04E+11,18.5, defended with a straight bat,1
23689,8.04E+11,18.4," ah, a big shout first up but umpire harper turns that -999 down because he got a stride in",1
23690,8.04E+11,18.3, cleaned him right up with a quicker -999 that rocketed against the pads off the bat and straight into the sticks. this -999 was always on the cards with strydom struggling against the spin.,1
23691,8.04E+11,18.2, hit -999 softly to square leg,1
23692,8.04E+11,18.1, attempts a drive but that's picked up by the bowler,1
23693,8.04E+11,6.6, behind this with a solid defensive shot,0
23694,8.04E+11,6.5, gets bat onto this -999 and it goes -999 into the off side,0
23695,8.04E+11,6.4," that was close as well, as masakadza lunges forward and is struck on the pad. but umpire harper gives him the benefit of the doubt although replays show it is very close",0
23696,8.04E+11,6.3," this -999 is right on line and chibhabha tries to play it through the on side, the ball straightens slightly and strikes the front pad just above the ankle. that is heading for middle and leg and bangladesh have their first breakthrough",0
23697,8.04E+11,6.2, defended on the move as mortaza pitches up,0
23698,8.04E+11,6.1," played from the crease, back to the bowler",0
23699,8.04E+11,4.6," sharp -999 into the covers, it will be important that zimbabwe run well in this innings",8
23700,8.04E+11,4.5, played off the front foot again and fielded by point,8
23701,8.04E+11,4.4, mortaza gets his line back and the batsman comes forward with a strong defensive shot,8
23702,8.04E+11,4.3, superb timing through square leg as mortaza drifts too straight again and a welcome boundary for taylor,8
23703,8.04E+11,4.2," connects well with this -999 and finds the gap at cover with an open face, not quite enough power to reach the fence but some good running",8
23704,8.04E+11,4.1, the bowler starts to go up in appeal but the ball is heading well down the leg side,8
23705,8.04E+11,2.6, another excellent delivery which squares the batsman up in defence. mortaza has started well here and is keeping the zimbabweans on their toes,1
23706,8.04E+11,2.5, shoulders arms as the ball shapes -999,1
23707,8.04E+11,2.4, blocked on the front foot but chibhabha doesn't look very comfortable,1
23708,8.04E+11,2.3, mortaza finding good areas and the batsman flashes outside off stump but the ball just misses the edge,1
23709,8.04E+11,2.2, defended into the covers,1
23710,8.04E+11,2.1," another fumble by bangladesh, this time by bashar at mid on. they can't afford to give -999 runs",1
23711,8.04E+11,0.6," solid forward defence by taylor, who has been moved up to the opening position for this innings",3
23712,8.04E+11,0.5, worked down to third man off the front foot,3
23713,8.04E+11,0.4, again drifting a little too straight and the batsman uses the pace of the ball to work it behind square as zimbabwe open their chase,3
23714,8.04E+11,0.3, raps the pads but is drifting down the leg side,3
23715,8.04E+11,0.2," fuller ball this time, attacking the stumps, and it's work to midwicket",3
23716,8.04E+11,0.1," good start from mortaza, short of a length and it climbs past the edge and carries nicely through to the keeper",3
23717,8.04E+11,18.6, driven to mid-off,0
23718,8.04E+11,18.5, the sluggish -999 comes into play to trouble the batsman. it stopped after landing on a length outside off and hinds gets into a tangle as he is through with his shot even before the ball arrives.,0
23719,8.04E+11,18.4, sails harmlessly through outside the off stump.,0
23720,8.04E+11,18.3, full and outside off and a flat footed drive to cover results,0
23721,8.04E+11,18.2," hinds had no clue about that slower -999. it almost turned in from just outside off, and hinds just got his bat -999 and thrusted his pad -999. hit outside the line.",0
23722,8.04E+11,18.1, slanted across hinds who lets it go through to the 'keeper,0
23723,8.04E+11,14.6," pitches wide outside off stump and holds its line, bravo lets it go through to the wicketkeeper",4
23724,8.04E+11,14.5, lara is -999. after negating -999 close shouts asad rauf uphelds this -999. it landed on a length on the middle and straightened. lara shaped up to cut and is cramped. tries desperately to bring his bat in front of his pad but it thuds into his front pad. would have hit the top of the middle. west indies are bleeding here.,4
23725,8.04E+11,14.4, again the slowness of this pitch beats an intended stroke. lara went for a drive through the off side ring but it stops on him and the inside edge takes it past square-leg,4
23726,8.04E+11,14.3," just short of length on the off,  lara cuts but can't beat point",4
23727,8.04E+11,14.2," shifts his line and alters the length. full and on the off and middle, driven powerfully to mid-off",4
23728,8.04E+11,14.1, maharoof tries to trap lara again with the -999 that straightens but this time lara makes contact.,4
23729,8.04E+11,4.6, and again.,1

23731,8.04E+11,4.4, stretches outside off to reach a outswinger and pushes it towards point,1
23732,8.04E+11,4.3, leans forward to a fullish delivery on the off to push it -999 to the off side.,1
23733,8.04E+11,4.2, almost gets his radar right this time. again it comes in and hinds falls over a bit in his attempt to flick it and is rapped on the pads. but it was going down leg.,1
23734,8.04E+11,4.2," vaas goes for the -999 that comes in, but ends up dragging it down the leg",1
23735,8.04E+11,4.1," went for the dream outswinger, the -999 that swings from middle and leg.  to his credit hinds didn't look to play it to the on side, chose to wait for the swing and albeit a bit ungainly, pushed it to off side",1
23736,8.04E+11,12.6, played to cover where sarwan dives to save runs,9
23737,8.04E+11,12.5, jayasuriya tries to heave it -999 of the stadium but doesn't make contact,9
23738,8.04E+11,12.4," another bounary, you can't bowl short and wide to jayasuriya unless you want to be cut for -999",9
23739,8.04E+11,12.3, bang! dropped short and jayasuriya took advantage of the width and slapped it over mid-off for -999,9
23740,8.04E+11,12.2," whoops, jayawardene was extremely early on the drive and stopped his shot, the ball lobs high in the air off a thick outside edge but falls just over cover",9
23741,8.04E+11,12.1," full and straight, driven back to the bowler",9
23742,8.04E+11,10.6," full and on jayawardene's legs, the batsman has no trouble in leaning across and flicking to the midwicket fence",11
23743,8.04E+11,10.5," fuller length and a touch slower, jayawardene gets forward and defends back past the bowler",11
23744,8.04E+11,10.4," full toss outside off stump, driven through cover point",11
23745,8.04E+11,10.3, banged in short again and this time jayasuriya times the pull shot to perfection and sends the ball speeding to the fence,11
23746,8.04E+11,10.3, sprayed wide outside off stump,11
23747,8.04E+11,10.2," banged in short this time, jayasuriya tries to pull but was very early on the shot and doesn't make contact",11
23748,8.04E+11,10.2," another no-ball, played to midwicket",11
23749,8.04E+11,10.1," short of a length outside off stump, jayasuriya tries to force it through the off side but doesn't time it well",11

23752,8.04E+11,9.4," short of a length, pitches outside off stump and angles -999 from jayawardene who lets it go",5
23753,8.04E+11,9.3," middle and leg stump line, pulled to fine leg",5
23754,8.04E+11,9.2," loud appeal for leg before but the umpire says no, that pitched outside leg and hit jayasuriya on the knee roll",5
23755,8.04E+11,9.1, defended on the off side,5
23756,8.04E+11,6.6," short and wide outside off stump, jayasuriya cuts it into the ground for a -999 to third man",3
23757,8.04E+11,6.5," fuller length on off stump, jayawardene tries to drive, went a little too hard at it and the ball flies to third man off the outside edge",3

23764,8.04E+11,34.2, huge shout for lbw  and don't know why taufel didn't give it. maybe a inside nick. landed outside the offstump and turned in sharply to hit him in front of middle and leg.,4
23765,8.04E+11,34.1, reverse swept fine! sehwag makes a good diving stop to pull the ball from the ropes. saves a run.,4
23766,8.04E+11,33.6, leans forward to a delivery on the length and defends it quite well. head over the ball and all that jazz,3

23773,8.04E+11,30.2, powar gets the nod from simon taufel this time. collingwood comes forward - walks forward rather - and powar again holds back the length and collingwood tries to work it to the on side and must have got an inside edge on to pads before it popped up for dhoni to hold a dolly.,1

23810,8.04E+11,5.1," perfect line on middle and off stump, angling across strauss from a good length, the batsman gets forward and defends to cover",0
23811,8.04E+11,2.6," shorter in length but not short enough for strauss's pull to come off, he gets a bottom edge to square leg",7
23812,8.04E+11,2.5," defended to point, the batsmen think about the sharp -999 but yuvraj's save sends them back",7
23813,8.04E+11,2.4," the first boundary of the innings and it's off an outside edge to the third man fence, strauss slashed at that outside off stump but it went wide off second slip",7
23814,8.04E+11,2.3," short of a length outside off stump, bell is quick to get on to the front foot and pushes it through cover",7
23815,8.04E+11,2.2," straighter line this time, that ball came back a touch and hit bell, who got well across, on the pad, half-hearted appeal for leg before is turned down",7
23816,8.04E+11,2.1," pitches outside the righthander's off stump from over the -999 and angles -999, bell lets it go",7
23817,8.04E+11,1.6," short of a length just outside off stump, strauss goes on the back foot and defends back to munaf",3
23818,8.04E+11,1.5, pushed on the front foot to cover,3
23819,8.04E+11,1.4," loose ball, drifting into the pads, strauss works it off his pads to deep fine leg where pathan runs across and picks it up -999-handed on the ropes",3
23820,8.04E+11,1.3," tight line on middle stump, that pitched on a good length again, strauss defends back to the bowler",3
23821,8.04E+11,1.2," good length again but straighter line, dabbed back past the bowler for a sharp -999 to mid-on, england are -999",3
23822,8.04E+11,1.1," good length outside off stump, defended on the front foot to point",3
23823,8.04E+11,21.6," slightly short, punched off the back-foot - well-timed shot but the ball goes straight to the fielder at cover",3
23824,8.04E+11,21.5, punched off the back-foot to silly mid-on,3
23825,8.04E+11,21.4, driven down to mid-on,3
23826,8.04E+11,21.3, cut -999 off the back-foot to the deep point region,3
23827,8.04E+11,21.1, driven down to long-off,3
23828,8.04E+11,20.5," fuller and on the pads, driven straight to the fielder at mid-on",5
23829,8.04E+11,20.4, defended outside the off stump,5
23830,8.04E+11,20.3," another full length delivery, drifting down the leg side but yuvraj fails to get bat on ball",5
23831,8.04E+11,20.2," right up there in the block-hole, yuvraj pushes forward to defend and the ball races -999 off the middle of the bat to the long-on fence - that's timing for you",5
23832,8.04E+11,20.1, wel-timed drive but straight to the fielder at cover,5
23833,8.04E+11,20.1," bowled from round the stumps, short and rising outside the off stump, yuvraj leaves it through to the keeper, no-ball called for overstepping",5
23834,8.04E+11,13.6," slower ball, around 112 kmph, picked early by yuvraj who punches it into the ground and over extra cover",6
23835,8.04E+11,13.5," beaten outside off, yuvraj has a slash at a delivery outside off but can't connect.",6
23836,8.04E+11,13.5," another short -999, they are really testing yuvraj with bumpers, swayed -999. taufel calls it a wide.",6
23837,8.04E+11,13.4," length-delivery outside off, punched on-the-up to mid-off",6
23838,8.04E+11,13.3," slower ball, 114.-999 kmph, fullish and on the leg and middle, tickled past square-leg",6
23839,8.04E+11,13.2, banged in short and it sails over the left shoulder of tendulkar who ducks under,6
23840,8.04E+11,13.1, shooter! 120.-999 kmph delivery that landed on a length outside off and almost rolled along the ground.,6
23841,8.04E+11,12.6, beaten! he tries to -999 that stroke but ends up driving inside the line.,11
23842,8.04E+11,12.5, overpitched outside off and yuvraj is on to it in a flash. left elbow high and a great follow through and the ball screams past cover,11
23843,8.04E+11,12.4," length delivery on the middle and off, tendulkar goes back and clips it in style past square-leg",11
23844,8.04E+11,12.3, short arm pull past square-leg,11
23845,8.04E+11,12.2," when yuvraj's bat came through in front of his pad, -999 thought it was just a defensive push, may be the ball will roll towards the bowler but instead, this speds between the bowler and mid-on for a classy -999. he checked his shot and just punched at it.",11
23846,8.04E+11,12.1," yorker and catches tendulkar by surprise. he is beaten for pace and is hit on the boot, but going down leg.",11
23847,8.04E+11,5.6," 142.5kmph delivery that hurried tendulkar and went through him. it landed short of length, on the off stump line and tendulkar hopped up and tried to work it to on side at the same time. it flicks his back thigh and goes through to chris read",2
23848,8.04E+11,5.5," 108.1kmph this time. a slower delivery. full on the off, driven to extra cover.",2
23849,8.04E+11,5.4," 137.5 kmph delivery that landed short of length, on the middle and leg, turned to midwicket",2
23850,8.04E+11,5.3," 140.9 kmph delivery, just outside off, pathan steers it to point",2
23851,8.04E+11,5.2," banged in short, on the middle, tendulkar hops up and behind to get on top of the bounce and tickles it to the on side",2
23852,8.04E+11,5.1," starts off well. length delivery in the corridor, left alone",2
23853,8.04E+11,44.6, 'ow-wozzat?' asks smith as patel is hit on the pad...but he's well outside the line,2
23854,8.04E+11,44.5," slightly shorter and patel pulls it, without the necessary power, to a deep midwicket",2
23855,8.04E+11,44.4, pushed back to mid-on,2
23856,8.04E+11,44.3, straighter ball which turns prodigiously,2
23857,8.04E+11,44.2, swept from outside the off stump to fine-leg,2
23858,8.04E+11,44.1, pushed back to the bowler,2
23859,8.04E+11,41.6," outside the off stump, kept a touch low and it's pushed -999 into the covers",8
23860,8.04E+11,41.5, a solid drive to mid-off,8
23861,8.04E+11,41.5," down the leg side. the batsman misses it, the wicketkeeper does too and it's five deliciously free runs for new zealand",8
23862,8.04E+11,41.4," oh he's got him! kallis fires in a bouncer which franklin can't quite cope with, spooning the ball off his elbow and onto the stumps. he was looking quite settled, franklin, too.",8
23863,8.04E+11,41.3, down the leg side and pushed off his pads for a -999,8
23864,8.04E+11,41.2," slightly squared up by -999 which cuts back into him, but franklin played it neatly, angling it down to third man right at the last moment",8
23865,8.04E+11,41.1, pushed -999 into the covers,8
23866,8.04E+11,39.6, paddled into the covers and franklin happy to leave fleming on strike,7
23867,8.04E+11,39.5, solid defence back to ntini,7
23868,8.04E+11,39.4, punched through the gap in the covers to the man -999 deep,7
23869,8.04E+11,39.2, guided to the fielder at point,7
23870,8.04E+11,39.1, a bit lucky. fleming played a back-foot pull which went high but into space and it plugged short of the rope at long on,7
23871,8.04E+11,34.6," too short, and fleming had time to steer into the gap on the off side",5
23872,8.04E+11,34.5, tip and run into the covers,5
23873,8.04E+11,34.4," reached and swept to backward square leg, all controlled",5
23874,8.04E+11,34.3, dabbed behind square on the off,5
23875,8.04E+11,34.2, prodigious turn and vettori left groping,5
23876,8.04E+11,34.1," short and wide, fleming reached and cut square",5
23877,8.04E+11,31.6, again peterson gives too much width and it's hammered through the covers to the man on the boundary,4
23878,8.04E+11,31.5, turned into the covers for an easy -999,4
23879,8.04E+11,31.4, driven to long off,4
23880,8.04E+11,31.3," short, shaped to cut, but bounced too much and he thwacked it into the ground",4
23881,8.04E+11,31.2," floated, played into the leg side",4
23882,8.04E+11,28.6," fuller length but kept a tad low and mccullum, who was back, had to jab down on it",5
23883,8.04E+11,28.5," good response from kallis, back in the groove",5
23884,8.04E+11,28.4," take that! mccullum spotted the short -999 early, leant back and hammered it to the midwicket boundary with interest. on this pitch the ball just sits up and begs to be belted",5
23885,8.04E+11,28.2, patted back to the bowler,5
23886,8.04E+11,28.1, pushed drive into the gap between cover and extra cover. nice placement from a player well set,5
23887,8.04E+11,21.6, pushed -999 into the covers,3
23888,8.04E+11,21.5, slower - 50mph - and fleming plays-and-misses. peterson roars the most unlikely of appeals,3
23889,8.04E+11,21.4, fuller and fleming times this -999 into the deep,3
23890,8.04E+11,21.3, fleming goes back and turns this into forward short-leg's hands,3
23891,8.04E+11,21.2, played off the back foot to the legside for a quick -999,3
23892,8.04E+11,21.1," and he gets immediate turn into the lefthander, plays it neatly into the legside",3
23893,8.04E+11,19.6, again he shoulders arms and this -999 jags back to the righthander,2
23894,8.04E+11,19.5, shoulders arms outside the offstump,2
23895,8.04E+11,19.4, down the legside and fleming rather misses -999 here. they scamper through for a -999,2
23896,8.04E+11,19.3," thick-edged down to third-man just for a -999. good line from nel, though, teasing the batsman",2
23897,8.04E+11,19.2, watchfully left alone by the righthander outside his offstump,2
23898,8.04E+11,15.6," now that's more like it from nel, finding some spice in that delivery which spat -999 from the lefthander who fended awkwardly at it.",5
23899,8.04E+11,15.5," good ball, good line, good length - good allround, and defended neatly by fleming. good cricket, in fact.",5
23900,8.04E+11,15.4," better line outside fleming's offstump who is cramped for room, punching it to point",5
23901,8.04E+11,15.3," ooh where's this gone? it's flicked off his legs in front of square, without great power but he's timed it beautifully and it sails over the infield for -999.&",5
23902,8.04E+11,15.2," tries to get this through the gap, times it neatly into the covers but it's a fine stop from smith",5
23903,8.04E+11,15.1," short and wide but astle can't get on top of it, clubbing it to point",5
23904,8.04E+11,8.6, astle tried to make room but pollock saw him coming and bowled into his body,6
23905,8.04E+11,8.5, tried to cut but too cramped and astle not able to get any power into the shot,6
23906,8.04E+11,8.4, wristily turned square into the gap on the leg side,6
23907,8.04E+11,8.3," overpitched, sweetly driven from middle-and-off wide of mid on",6
23908,8.04E+11,8.2," good run, again the pace taken off the ball as it plopped to midwicket allowing a scurried -999",6
23909,8.04E+11,8.1," punched to extra cover, a momentary thought of a -999 from astle but fleming not interested",6
23910,8.04E+11,6.6, beaten outside off stump,1
23911,8.04E+11,6.5, flicked to midwicket,1
23912,8.04E+11,6.4," the plan works! vincent goes on the back foot, plays across the line and his middle stump is knocked back. he had looked to get forward whenever possible. first pollock cramped him by bowling a tight line, and so prevented him using his arms, and then boucher came up to the stumps to stop him using his feet",1
23913,8.04E+11,6.3, flicked off middle-and-leg but straight to the man on 45 saving the -999,1
23914,8.04E+11,6.2, slightly shorter on off stump and vincent cramped for room,1
23915,8.04E+11,6.1," nice cricket, took the pace off the ball with a dead bat and a quick run. good understanding between the batsmen made that easy when it could have been a bit frantic",1
23916,8.04E+11,5.6, pulled from outside off stump between midwicket and mid on with real venom,4
23917,8.04E+11,5.5, textbook drive but straight to mid off,4
23918,8.04E+11,5.4," leg-stump line, blocked",4
23919,8.04E+11,5.3, loud and confident shout as the ball zips past his outside edge. replays show the ball missed the bat but his bat did brush the pad. good decision.,4
23920,8.04E+11,5.2, short of a length and seemed to pick up pace off the pitch and through vincent's defensive push,4
23921,8.04E+11,5.1," straight ball, no room for vincent to do much with that",4
23922,8.04E+11,0.6, pushed to extra cover for what would have been a tight -999 but dippenaar stumbled and completely missed the ball and a scrambled -999 became an easy -999,3
23923,8.04E+11,0.5, outside off stump and a momentary worry for pollock that could be called a wide,3
23924,8.04E+11,0.4, again a good line and vincent has to defend once more,3
23925,8.04E+11,0.3," on off stump, correct defensive stroke",3
23926,8.04E+11,0.2," gentle -999-swing outside off stump, left alone",3
23927,8.04E+11,0.1, slight inswing but still beat vincent and a half-hearted appeal for -999 going down the leg and also a bit high,3
23928,8.04E+11,32.6," got him! now that's a real cracker, superbly bowled from patel. he gave that an extra rip; the quicker ball, flatter too, and it beat the batsman all ends up. he was in no position to counter the spin, his wafty defensive, and utterly horizontal stroke making no contact and off came the bail.",5
23929,8.04E+11,32.5, well bowled! quicker ball which hurries the batsman who jams his bat down just in time,5
23930,8.04E+11,32.4," a spectacular swing-and-a-miss. it's do or die, now.",5
23931,8.04E+11,32.3," oops, nearly got into a tangle there...feet like concrete",5
23932,8.04E+11,32.2," better aggression from the batsman this time who comes down the pitch, meets the pitch of the ball and smashes him over long-on",5
23933,8.04E+11,32.1," more prodigious drift and turn for patel and half an appeal from the bowler and wicketkeeper, but it hit nothing",5
23934,8.04E+11,25.6, hall content to see -999 the over,2
23935,8.04E+11,25.5, vettori turned that back into hall but he read it and blocked,2
23936,8.04E+11,25.4, read that nicely and left it alone,2
23937,8.04E+11,25.3, happy to block that -999,2
23938,8.04E+11,25.2, up there and hall hits it in the air over the infield. the ever-keen patel scurries round to field inches inside the ropes,2
23939,8.04E+11,25.1, really tight bowling from vettori,2
23940,8.04E+11,23.6, nothing doing here either. the field is tight and not allowing any gimmies,2
23941,8.04E+11,23.5, a bit more clout and it has enough to beat the dive of extra cover,2
23942,8.04E+11,23.4, driven to extra cover,2
23943,8.04E+11,23.3, again on the spot,2
23944,8.04E+11,23.2," took -999 step and almost converted the ball into a yorker, but dug it -999 with ease",2
23945,8.04E+11,23.1, punched into the gap between cover and extra cover,2
23946,8.04E+11,21.6," lovely end to a maiden ... bit and turned, kicking up dust and beating kemp's defensive lunge",0
23947,8.04E+11,21.5, more flight and driven hard back at vettori who scrambles to stop it,0
23948,8.04E+11,21.4, a bit wider and edged drive to backward point,0
23949,8.04E+11,21.3, kemp can't do anything with these and he cannot afford to take any chances,0
23950,8.04E+11,21.2, and again,0
23951,8.04E+11,21.1, straight on the spot,0
23952,8.04E+11,20.6, oh dear. smith tried to force a ball over the infield and it wasn't short enough. he was late on the shot and spooned it to vettori who didn't have to move off the line of the fielding circle at mid off,2
23953,8.04E+11,20.5," prodded off the outside edge to third man. quite deliberate, quite controlled",2
23954,8.04E+11,20.4, straight and blocked,2
23955,8.04E+11,20.3, steered behind square on the off,2
23956,8.04E+11,20.2," ha! the tv commentator chirps how tidy mccullum has been so he drops the next -999. but, in fairness, he has kept really well standing up",2
23957,8.04E+11,20.1, that -999 bounced and so beat smith's attempt to nurdle it down to third man,2
23958,8.04E+11,11.6," smith charges down the pitch again, but can only defend it",1
23959,8.04E+11,11.3," oh he's crashed this -999 too; these are making a lovely, crisp, clunk off the bat but again he can't find the gap",1
23960,8.04E+11,11.2, driven with a crisp clunk of the bat to mid-off,1
23961,8.04E+11,11.1," carved off the back foot, that was hit like a tracer but marshall cuts it off with another fine save in the covers",1
23962,8.04E+11,7.6," smith comes down the pitch, nudges it to the leg side but again can't find a gap",1
23963,8.04E+11,7.5," smith smacks this on-the-up, but again he can't find the gap",1
23964,8.04E+11,7.4, a flourishing drive but kallis gets an inside edge which flies down to fine-leg,1
23965,8.04E+11,7.3, driven with greater force but straight to mid-off,1
23966,8.04E+11,7.2," goes on the front foot this time, kallis, pushing it -999 into the covers",1
23967,8.04E+11,7.1, defended off the back foot with a high left elbow,1
23968,8.04E+11,3.6, a scampered and fraught -999 to mid-on,6
23969,8.04E+11,3.6," ooh that'll be close, kallis is rapped on the pad but...franklin has overstepped. well, it would have been close",6
23970,8.04E+11,3.5, slightly slower and wider from franklin and kallis leaves it well alone. no need to play at those,6
23971,8.04E+11,3.4, kallis comes forward this time to defend with the straightest of bats,6
23972,8.04E+11,3.3, swinging -999 from the right hander,6
23973,8.04E+11,3.2, squared up - touch more bounce there this time for franklin - and kallis again adjusts his stroke to play it down by his feet,6
23974,8.04E+11,3.1," off the back foot, kallis inside-edges this past his stumps and not far from mccullum's left glove. very fortunate",6
23975,8.04E+11,48.6," quicker and fuller, punched straight back to the bowler",4
23976,8.04E+11,48.5, nicely driven down to long-on for a -999,4
23977,8.04E+11,48.4," tossed up outside the off stump and vaas slogs it -999 to deep midwicket, once bounce and straight to the fielder in the deep",4
23978,8.04E+11,48.3, turned -999 with the spin to the midwicket region,4
23979,8.04E+11,48.2, beaten outside the off stump,4
23980,8.04E+11,48.1," bowled from round the stumps, fuller in length and vaas drives it down to long-off for a -999 - that brings fernando back on stike ",4
23981,8.04E+11,45.6," and it gets even better! straight and on the stumps, maharoof makes room in an effort to go over extra-cover but miserably fails to make contact and the ball craches into the woodwork",2
23982,8.04E+11,45.5," line and length, vaas drives on the front foot and the ball rolls down to long-off, excellent over so far",2
23983,8.04E+11,45.4," another tight delivery, turned -999 towards midwicket",2
23984,8.04E+11,45.3," came in from wide outside the leg stump, vaas fails to make contact and the ball rolls -999 off the pad, appeal for lbw turned down",2
23985,8.04E+11,45.1," good length and wide of the off stump, maharoof drives off the back foot",2
23986,8.04E+11,44.6, nicely worked -999 through the vacant midwicket region,5
23987,8.04E+11,44.5," worked -999 with the spin to short fine leg, again just the -999",5
23988,8.04E+11,44.4, driven down to long-on for an easy -999,5
23989,8.04E+11,38.6, driven back down the track - hafeez moves across quickly and cuts off the -999,2
23990,8.04E+11,38.5," quicker delivery, played -999 towards cover",2
23991,8.04E+11,38.5, drifting down the leg side,2
23992,8.04E+11,38.4, drives coming down the track but fails to get it past the bowler,2

24532,8.04E+11,31.1, hit straight to mid-off and they run with the stroke. vaas will be on strike now.,7

24536,8.04E+11,28.3," and then there were -999. maharoof' lack of footwork does him in. on a driveable length outside the off stump, maharoof drives, his feet sticking adhesively to the crease, and doesn't lean onto his drive, gets an outside edge and is swallowed by smith in the slips.",2
24537,8.04E+11,28.2, banged in short and pulled over the infield. didn't time it well though.,2
24538,8.04E+11,28.1," full and on the off, coming in a touch, maharoof has a waft at it, gets his bat down slightly outside the line and the ball rolls to the on side",2

24585,8.04E+11,44.5, big swing but styris misses what would have been a heave to end all heaves,7
24586,8.04E+11,44.4, oram misses a swipe but there is still a leg bye as it bobbles off his pads,7
24587,8.04E+11,44.3, a second dot ball will cheer up pakistan,7

24594,8.04E+11,40.2, steered into the covers,2
24595,8.04E+11,40.1, blocked with no fuss,2
24596,8.04E+11,35.6," still too much width, dabbed down to third man",9
24597,8.04E+11,35.5, better delivery this time,9
24598,8.04E+11,35.3," ambitious stroke, down for the sweep and attempts to flick an off-stump ball over his shoulder. doesn't connect, but that'll make the bowler think",9
24599,8.04E+11,35.2," poor bowling from malik, drifting onto the pads",9
24600,8.04E+11,35.1," pakistan are losing the plot a bit here. too short again, this time from malik, and styris cashes in with a thumping cut through point",9
24601,8.04E+11,34.6," and the end of a fine over for new zealand, as afridi drifts onto the pads and watches aghast as the ball whistles down to the fine-leg boundary",13
24602,8.04E+11,34.5," more runs now as fleming takes the attack to afridi, and wins.",13
24603,8.04E+11,34.4," lovely strike - too short again, and effortlessly cut behind square for another -999 through third man",13
24604,8.04E+11,34.3, tucked up on leg-stump,13
24605,8.04E+11,34.2," dropped into the off side, finds the gap and good running",13
24606,8.04E+11,34.1, too short and smeared into the leg-side. fielded with a tumble on the boundary's edge,13
24607,8.04E+11,32.6, driven into the covers,4
24608,8.04E+11,32.5," a bit of a shimmy at the crease, and that's well played in the end, finding space on the off side",4
24609,8.04E+11,32.4," new zealand are looking to dominate afridi, but he's bowling cleverly so far",4
24610,8.04E+11,32.3," more belligerent strokeplay, and this time there's a -999 into the covers",4
24611,8.04E+11,32.2," bit of a whoosh outside off stump, but finds nothing but air",4
24612,8.04E+11,32.1," scampered -999, but makes his ground comfortably",4
24613,8.04E+11,31.6," that's a beautiful shot to bring up the drinks break. fuller and swinging, and perfectly timed through the leg-side. bisects the -999 fielders converging at midwicket, and beats them both comfortably. well played",8
24614,8.04E+11,31.5, nothing doing this time,8
24615,8.04E+11,31.4," slower delivery - that was a 62mph off-cutter, but well picked and tucked -999 for a couple",8
24616,8.04E+11,31.3," short of a length, and pushed back onto the stumps",8
24617,8.04E+11,31.2," that's much better, hounding the top of off stump, but squeezed -999 for a -999",8
24618,8.04E+11,31.2," poor ball - too much width, and over-steps as well",8
24619,8.04E+11,31.1, a lot rests on new zealand's captain ... as ever,8
24620,8.04E+11,24.6, punched to point. a good over from iftikhar,2
24621,8.04E+11,24.5," driven with more power, whipping the ball from off stump to mid on",2
24622,8.04E+11,24.4, fleming turned square as he pushes the ball back up the pitch,2
24623,8.04E+11,24.3," drive-push to mid off, no power in it",2
24624,8.04E+11,24.2, paddled -999 on the leg side into  space,2
24625,8.04E+11,24.1, steered to fine leg,2
24626,8.04E+11,23.6, blocked to end the over,0
24627,8.04E+11,23.5," driven to extra cover, an utter mix-up between the batsmen after a diving stop by farhat  at point and akmal had to hit the stumps from about -999 yards -999 with styris floundering to get back ... and missed",0
24628,8.04E+11,23.4, slightly wider and styris opts to leave it alone,0
24629,8.04E+11,23.3, syris shapes to flat-bat a short and wide ball through the covers but misses,0
24630,8.04E+11,23.2," full, driven to extra over",0
24631,8.04E+11,23.1," short, seams back in and styris plays it off the back foot",0
24632,8.04E+11,22.6, -999-quarter controlled shot off the edge down to third man where it is well stopped,4
24633,8.04E+11,22.5," and as if to prove me utterly wrong, iftikhar strays to leg and fleming flicks it into the gap between midwicket and mid on",4
24634,8.04E+11,22.4," fleming being tied down by some tight bowling. again, he can do no more than pat this into the off-side ring",4
24635,8.04E+11,22.3, slightly shorter and played off the back foot to cover,4
24636,8.04E+11,22.2, turned straight to midwicket,4
24637,8.04E+11,22.1, patted into the covers,4
24638,8.04E+11,21.6, driven with some power but straight to mid off,6
24639,8.04E+11,21.5, worked with the angle behind square and long leg has a lot of ground to make up,6
24640,8.04E+11,21.5," slower ball, wide and getting wider which styris half-heartedly spars at",6
24641,8.04E+11,21.4, angled behind square on the off,6
24642,8.04E+11,21.3, lovely ball that leaves fleming in the air as he gropes for it,6
24643,8.04E+11,21.2," drive intended to go through mid off, but the ball squirts off the edge square on the leg side",6
24644,8.04E+11,21.1," good line, good length and fleming can only block",6
24645,8.04E+11,17.6," leg-side, but can't middle an attempted flick",4
24646,8.04E+11,17.5," forcing shot off the back foot, slightly streaky as the ball flies through the vacant gully region. cleaned up on the boundary's edge",4
24647,8.04E+11,17.4," nice languid drive, but can't beat the field",4
24648,8.04E+11,17.3, shorter and beaten. looked like an open face and an attempted steer to third man,4
24649,8.04E+11,17.2," solidly forward with bat and pad together, and an easy -999 as he picks the gap on the off side. nice percentage shot",4
24650,8.04E+11,17.1," short and leg-side, played down off the hips",4
24651,8.04E+11,7.6," left alone, a decent end to a poor over",10
24652,8.04E+11,7.5, gul again strays down the leg and fleming clips it through midwicket,10
24653,8.04E+11,7.4, left alone outside off stump,10
24654,8.04E+11,7.3, driven to mid on,10
24655,8.04E+11,7.2, gul overcompensates and fleming smacks a short ball over wide mid-on,10
24656,8.04E+11,7.1," neat drive through the covers, well timed and all along the ground. that underlined the difference that getting your feet in the right place makes",10
24657,8.04E+11,44.6," oh dear, down the leg side and -999 to the boundary. a bit of a slack finish from mills, but a good spell nonetheless",7
24658,8.04E+11,44.5, short and carved uppishly to third man. but still no boundaries,7
24659,8.04E+11,44.4," but instead of a boundary, that's another dot. it's all a bit futile now for pakistan",7
24660,8.04E+11,44.3," short and swished into the leg side. pakistan need boundaries, urgently",7
24661,8.04E+11,44.2," firm drive, but can't beat mid-off",7
24662,8.04E+11,44.1, finds the gap and at last akmal has the strike,7
24663,8.04E+11,33.6, intended loop over extra cover,9
24664,8.04E+11,33.5, angled again but this time with less power and squarer,9
24665,8.04E+11,33.4," intelligent cricket. shoaib shaped to come down the track, vettori fired it in short and shoaib angled the ball fine past the man at short third man. lovely stuff",9
24666,8.04E+11,33.3, shoaib uses his feet but ends up reaching for it and so doesn't get hold of it. it plops into the soft turf 20 yards in from the long-on boundary,9
24667,8.04E+11,33.2, yousuf  waits and cuts through the covers,9
24668,8.04E+11,33.1, yousuf takes -999 strides down the track but can only paddle into the leg side,9
24669,8.04E+11,30.6," worked up to the man at long on. a good over for pakistan and , importantly, pressure being put on the fielders",7
24670,8.04E+11,30.5, much tighter and yousuf punches down to block,7
24671,8.04E+11,30.4, pushed through and shoaib slightly hurries as he drives it to long on,7
24672,8.04E+11,30.3, neatly steered square on the off and again placement means they can run -999 to the man in the deep,7
24673,8.04E+11,30.2," short again, and flicked square on the leg side, but the fielder is in closer and no chance of -999 this time",7
24674,8.04E+11,30.1, pushed into the leg side and yousuf  takes on the arm of the man in the deep and makes it ...but only after a reference to the third umpire,7
24675,8.04E+11,25.6," width this time, but no way through. a tidy over to tie pakistan down",2
24676,8.04E+11,25.5, pushed back onto the stumps this time. good use of the crease by vettori,2
24677,8.04E+11,25.4," beaten in the flight. canny bowling, yousuf might have popped a return catch if he'd gone through with his shot",2
24678,8.04E+11,25.3," aggressive intent, but long-off cleans up",2
24679,8.04E+11,25.2," a bit of a long-hop, frankly, but vettori gets -999 with it as yousuf picks -999 the cover sweeper",2
24680,8.04E+11,25.1, vettori keeps it tight again,2
24681,8.04E+11,19.6," and franklin serves it up, wide and driven through the covers, across the dew-soaked outfield to the rope",5
24682,8.04E+11,19.5, shoaib tied down once more. he is growing a bit frustrated and needs something to feed on,5
24683,8.04E+11,19.4, finally yousuf manages to find a gap with a straight drive to the right of franklin,5
24684,8.04E+11,19.3, and once more yousuf chooses to watch it pass by,5
24685,8.04E+11,19.2, better line,5
24686,8.04E+11,19.1," wide and goes on with the arm as yousuf stretches to try to drive. the ball glistens in the lights, showing that the outfield is damp",5
24687,8.04E+11,18.6, shoaib forced onto the back foot. he gives a rueful smile,2
24688,8.04E+11,18.5, tight bowling and a chorus of encouragement comes form almost every new zealand fielder,2
24689,8.04E+11,18.4, oram errs to leg and yousuf steers square,2
24690,8.04E+11,18.3, paddled into the off side,2
24691,8.04E+11,18.2," short and left alone. oram is really hard to get -999 on this pitch, largely because of the bounce he generates",2
24692,8.04E+11,18.1, worked into the leg side ... nothing doing. oram is proving to be the star of the day so far,2
24693,8.04E+11,16.6, shoaib backs -999 and plays into the off side,2
24694,8.04E+11,16.5, edged with uncertainty through third slip,2
24695,8.04E+11,16.4, malik spars at it with little footwork and hardly surprising he misses it,2
24696,8.04E+11,16.3, short and left alone,2
24697,8.04E+11,16.2," short, zipped back in and passes shoaib at chest height",2
24698,8.04E+11,16.1," banged in, afridi top edges an attempted hook and the ball arcs straight to bond at short fine leg  a buzz accompanied afridi to the middle but he returned in silence",2
24699,8.04E+11,12.6, wide and left alone,0
24700,8.04E+11,12.5, afridi forced to play from the off,0
24701,8.04E+11,12.4," once again oram gets extra bounce - not surprising given he is -999'5' - and hafeez spars at the ball, gets a thick edge and mccullum takes a diving catch wide to his right",0
24702,8.04E+11,12.3, some confusion between the batsmen. the ball is returned to mccullum who spots yousuf -999 of his ground and hurls the ball at the non-striker's end. would have been interesting had he hit,0
24703,8.04E+11,12.2, cuts it in from outside off stump but left alone,0
24704,8.04E+11,12.1," unwinds at 77mph, on the button and played into the covers",0
24705,8.04E+11,9.6, pushed -999 to extra-cover,9
24706,8.04E+11,9.5, pushed onto the back foot. better reply,9
24707,8.04E+11,9.4," another boundary and that's a great little dinky back-cut - too short from franklin, you can't put it there at his pace, and the ball races -999 to the fence",9
24708,8.04E+11,9.3," now that's a cracking strike! beautiful thump straight down the ground. if there'd been any pigeons there, they'd have been scattered",9
24709,8.04E+11,9.2," onto the back foot, can't put it -999. tight stuff from the kiwis here",9
24710,8.04E+11,9.1," well, that's an expansive slap down to third man, and an easy -999. big partnership this for the pakistanis",9
24711,8.04E+11,5.6," excellent delivery to finish as this -999 cuts back into the batsman, but there's a squirted -999 available on the leg side. good over",1

25225,8.04E+11,9.3, another bouncer from taylor who is clearly riled by taufel's decision,0
25226,8.04E+11,9.2, taylor replies with a bouncer,0
25227,8.04E+11,9.1, 'that's -999'  we all shriek. bosman caught in the crease playing across the line and it hit him right in front. simon taufel disagrees,0
25228,8.04E+11,8.6, kallis looked to make room but bradshaw cramped him,2
25229,8.04E+11,8.5, angled down to third man. west indies will be happy to let bosman keep the strike,2
25230,8.04E+11,8.4, again bosman was glued to the crease and was well beaten outside the off stump. that died on baugh as he had to dive to take it low down,2
25231,8.04E+11,8.3, half forward and he played and missed,2
25232,8.04E+11,8.2, that gave bosman the width to play a shot but he failed to time it at all and his attempted cut trickled into the covers,2
25233,8.04E+11,8.1, a bit shorter and bosman too cramped to do anything with it,2
25234,8.04E+11,8.1, bradshaw finds a better line. he's been wayward so far,2
25235,8.04E+11,34.6, defended solidly,8
25236,8.04E+11,34.5, pushed off his pads for another -999,8
25237,8.04E+11,34.4," and he loses his line here, angling it down the leg side to allow a quick -999",8
25238,8.04E+11,34.3," glorious, a lovely cut with a real caribbean flourish, hammering it past backward point for -999. sumptuous",8
25239,8.04E+11,34.2," quicker (83.9mph) and right on bravo's off stump who watchfully comes forward, presenting the straightest of bats",8
25240,8.04E+11,34.1, wild! wild and woolly down the leg side,8
25241,8.04E+11,32.6, attempted yorker from nel - good thinking but it turned -999 to be a half-volley allowing sarwan to chip it to the leg side,4
25242,8.04E+11,32.5," digs this into gayle who pulls it, but without any timing or power",4
25243,8.04E+11,32.4, a scampered -999,4
25244,8.04E+11,32.3," good grief, what happened there? a shorter delivery and sarwan comes down the pitch, trying to pull it,  and bottom-edges it ungainly. no need for such aggression whatsoever...",4
25245,8.04E+11,32.2," well bowled; full, straight and quick, sarwan is forced to defend his stumps",4
25246,8.04E+11,17.6," pushed -999 into the covers, again no timing",14
25247,8.04E+11,17.5," pushed off his legs, crab-like.",14
25248,8.04E+11,17.3, more power from gayle but straight to mid-off this time,14
25249,8.04E+11,17.2," even better! a quite remarkable shot, standing tall and driving it past kallis's right hand. long-off didn't stand a chance and it torpedoed for -999",14
25250,8.04E+11,17.1," oh, shot! as boycott might say, 'shot, boy, shot' as gayle rocks back to pull a shorter delivery over midwicket for a massive -999. bosh indeed",14
25251,8.04E+11,17.1," defended off the back foot with the straightest of bats, but it's a no-ball from kallis. smith looks worried...",14
25252,8.04E+11,4.6," slower ball to finish the over, and chanderpaul was nearly suckered. had to check his stroke, but did so effectively",7
25253,8.04E+11,4.5," outside off, and eased through the gap in the covers. no great power or timing, but the placement was perfect",7
25254,8.04E+11,4.4," there's so little margin for error for pollock, but he gets it right this time as cover fields",7
25255,8.04E+11,4.3," that's better, but another -999 as gayle picks the gap in the covers",7
25256,8.04E+11,4.2," whumph! that went like an absolute bat -999 of hell, driven straight as a die down the ground. you can't bowl there to gayle",7
25257,8.04E+11,4.1," good length, seemed to keep low as gayle played off the back foot, but then he is quite tall. fielded at short cover",7
25258,8.04E+11,2.6, dabbed to third man again,3
25259,8.04E+11,2.5," a touch too short, but gayle - swinging off the back foot - can't reach the boundary",3
25260,8.04E+11,2.4," outside off, and dabbed down to fine leg. shiv is off the mark",3
25261,8.04E+11,2.3," -999-to--999, and chanderpaul is squared up as he defends. but then, he's always squared up, so that's no great news",3
25262,8.04E+11,2.2, solid start to this over from pollock.,3
25263,8.04E+11,2.1," outside off stump, left alone. pollock scratches his footholes",3
25264,8.04E+11,18.6," this -999's full and moving -999, samuels leaves it alone, fine over from mcgrath",0
25265,8.04E+11,18.5," brings this -999 into him, he defends and almost gets an inside edge",0
25266,8.04E+11,18.4," good length outside off stump, pushed to cover&",0
25267,8.04E+11,18.3," full outside off stump, left alone",0
25268,8.04E+11,18.2," gone! hits the deck on a great length - typical mcgrath - and morton stands and chases it, a regulation thick edge into gilchrist's gloves and west indies slip further",0
25269,8.04E+11,18.1," lands outside off and raps him on the front leg as he comes forward, a muted appeal from mcgrath and gilchrist",0
25270,8.04E+11,17.6," tossed down quicker and bravo has to adjust his drive, ends up almost tapping that back to symonds",2
25271,8.04E+11,17.5, short again but he cant beat the man at cover,2
25272,8.04E+11,17.4," lands outside off and spins in,  bravo makes room and cuts to cover",2
25273,8.04E+11,17.3," tossed up on middle and leg, comes forward and flicks to midwicket",2
25274,8.04E+11,17.2," tossed up on middle and off, comes forward and defends",2
25275,8.04E+11,17.1," lands flat on middle and leg, he goes back and works that past ponting",2
25276,8.04E+11,13.6," a good length ball on middle and off, he stands tall and whips that past square leg for -999, good shot",4
25277,8.04E+11,13.5," great ball! full and fast, lands outside off stump, sucks him into an expansive drive, and moves enough to beat his bat, that was close",4
25278,8.04E+11,13.4," fast delivery outside off stump and lifting, bravo shoulders arms",4
25279,8.04E+11,13.3," short of a good length, bravo drives off the backfoot to mid-off, not timed well",4
25280,8.04E+11,13.2," a good length on off stump, bravo drives back to lee",4
25281,8.04E+11,13.1," short of a good length outside off stump, bravo stands and defends to cover",4
25282,8.04E+11,12.6," good length again outside off stump, lara comes forward and squeezes that to backward point",0
25283,8.04E+11,12.5," full and seaming -999 outside off stump, he shoulders arms",0
25284,8.04E+11,12.4," quicker ball on the stumps, lara defends",0
25285,8.04E+11,12.3," fuller this time, lara gets right on top of that with some exagerrated frontfoot defense",0
25286,8.04E+11,12.2," another good ball swinging -999, lara gets a stride forward and raises the bat",0
25287,8.04E+11,12.1," good ball moving across him from off stump, lara covers off stump and shoulders arms",0
25288,8.04E+11,0.6," too full and he firmly punches that in the gap between clarke at backward point an symonds at cover and the ball again speeds -999 across the quick outfield, good shot",10
25289,8.04E+11,0.5," good, quick ball on the stumps, chanderpaul defends with a straight bat",10
25290,8.04E+11,0.4," this stands up as well at a rapid pace, chanderpaul's caught trying to drive towards mid-off but the ball takes the outer edge and speeds past gully, the fast outfield gets him -999, streaky",10
25291,8.04E+11,0.3," this lands on off stump and kicks up, chanderpaul does well to stand and keep that down with soft hands, well bowled and well played",10
25292,8.04E+11,0.2," pitched on leg and moving down, gayle falls over trying to defend, swings a lot down leg",10
25293,8.04E+11,0.1," good length ball outside off stump, some swing there, nudged past gully down to third man for -999 first-thing",10
25294,8.04E+11,19.6," taylor ends his spell - only 7 overs, this is a 35-overs game now - with a bouncer. easily ducked under.",8
25295,8.04E+11,19.5," super shot. taylor attempts an yorker, ends up serving it full on the legs, watson gets his front foot -999 of the line, doesn't lunge across like ponting did, and drives it past mid-on.",8
25296,8.04E+11,19.4," and almost a -999. slightly shorter in length, and he goes back and across to punch it past point.",8
25297,8.04E+11,19.3," length-delivery, just outside the offstump, and watson pings the deep point with a cracking square-drive on a bent knee.",8
25298,8.04E+11,19.2," back-of-length delivery, around the offstump line, punched back down the track",8
25299,8.04E+11,19.1," drifting on the legs, attempted flick, clips the pads enroute to baugh",8
25300,8.04E+11,18.6, leans forward to smother the spin. not that there is much of it.,1
25301,8.04E+11,18.5," on the middle again, driven to mid-on",1

25307,8.04E+11,16.4," beaten outside off. it was full and slanted -999, watson initially shaped up to leave it but had a change of mind and poked at it.",8
25308,8.04E+11,16.3," this is all getting rather easy. another short of length delivery, punched past cover.",8
25309,8.04E+11,16.2," fuller and on the off and middle, watson eases forward to place it to right of mid-on",8
25310,8.04E+11,16.1," on the off and middle stump line, slightly short of length, whipped past square-leg and they come back for -999, beating chanderpaul's throw",8
25311,8.04E+11,4.5," just outside the offstump, left alone",4

25318,8.04E+11,2.6," got him! gilchrist falls early. bradshaw pinged the full length and in the channel outside offstump. gilchrist ends up driving on-the-up and inside the line and the ball moves just enough to take the outside edge. flew straight to gayle at first slip who swallows it. -999 down, nine to go for west indies while australia require another 127 runs",2
25319,8.04E+11,2.5," length-delivery, slanting -999, watson dabs it to thirdman.",2
25320,8.04E+11,2.4, wrong. hits the deck short of length this time and gilchrist swivels of his front foot to pull it to deep backward square-leg. got to pitch it up.,2
25321,8.04E+11,2.3," again full in length, and on the middle and off, driven to mid-on.  bradshaw is going to pitch it up, hoping for some swing.",2
25322,8.04E+11,2.2," pitches it further up, just outside the offstump, gilchrist brings his bat down and takes it ahead of his body, makes contact and the ball rolls to mid-off",2

25324,8.04E+11,15.6," widish length ball, an driven to deep cover for -999",7
25325,8.04E+11,15.5, mccullum has saved at least -999 more here. -999 am counting it at nine. pushed with a straight bat. looks like an easy -999 towards long-off because the mid-off is back and there is no -999 back. except that at the last moment mccullum comes flying in. no run,7
25326,8.04E+11,15.4," on a length, outside off, runs this off the outside half of the bat into the vacant third-man region",7
25327,8.04E+11,15.3," wide length ball, driven square, vettori has to do some work to get around from third man and keep this -999 in  with a late dive",7
25328,8.04E+11,15.2," that's seven runs saved in the field. he has run this off the face towards third man, but williamson flies at gully to save -999 run",7
25329,8.04E+11,15.1," length ball, off, not swinging, defended with an open face",7
25330,8.04E+11,13.6, this -999 is straight and at the stumps. defended to mid-on,0
25331,8.04E+11,13.5," length ball outside off, doesn't do anything. left alone",0
25332,8.04E+11,13.4," nearly bowled him. full and just outside off, and he has played down the wrong line",0
25333,8.04E+11,13.3," oh ho ho. nearly works that plan. this is a big swinging delivery. morgan thinks he can play this to leg, but the ball swings and opens him up. the leading edge doesn't carry to short cover-point",0
25334,8.04E+11,13.2," full and swing -999, left alone",0
25335,8.04E+11,13.1," ballance is back, this is a shortish delivery, has some width too, and is there to be hit. but the ball just doesn't come on. ballance has to wait. he tries to check the shot, but because his feet haven't moved he is not close to the line of the ball. he ends up toe-ending this softly. a simple catch to short cover. boult gets a seventh over, and he has struck first ball",0
25336,8.04E+11,12.6," similar length but starts too straight, and is picked -999 for a -999",6

25342,8.04E+11,10.6, tucks him up with a shortish delivery. hurries him up too,3
25343,8.04E+11,10.5," that's a beauty. it seems this might swing back in. the trajectory in the air suggests that. upon pitching, though, it seams -999 and beats the bat",3
25344,8.04E+11,10.4," and now he hits the right line. middle and off, and then nipping back in towards middle and leg. beats the bat, hits the pad, but it is bouncing over",3
25345,8.04E+11,10.4, another wide down leg. milne yet to hit his straps,3
25346,8.04E+11,10.4, wide down the leg side as he digs in short again,3

25351,8.04E+11,9.5," digs this -999 in short, root pulls, not entirely convincingly, but gets a -999 to long leg",1
25352,8.04E+11,9.4," on a length, around off, defended from the crease",1
25353,8.04E+11,9.3," fuller, just holds its line as opposed to going through with the angle, gets an inside edge onto the pad. no short leg to swallow this",1
25354,8.04E+11,9.2," short of a length, outside off, pushed to point",1
25355,8.04E+11,9.1, defended off the back foot,1
25356,8.04E+11,5.6," short of a length, just outside off, defended from the crease",4
25357,8.04E+11,5.5," a touch too full, a touch too straight, clipped -999 towards deep square for a couple",4

25361,8.04E+11,5.1," big lbw shout but it isn't given by rod tucker. ballance has moved too far across as boult ones straight with the angle. mccullum has a chat with boult, and reviews it. just short of a length, pretty straight, ballance has moved too far across and is caught in front. but it is bouncing over, as the replays suggest. nz lose the review. it serves them right too because these milimetre calls is not what drs is for",4
25362,8.04E+11,40.6," can't find it, short of a length, no pace on the ball and driven straight to mid-off",2
25363,8.04E+11,40.5," finally the -999 is taken, driven to mid-off for a sharp -999. naeem will want the strike though so needs a -999 here",2
25364,8.04E+11,40.4," more careful, nothing defence. good work from botha and precious deliveries ticking by",2
25365,8.04E+11,40.3, again this is steered without much footwork or intent to the point fielder,2
25366,8.04E+11,40.2," shafiul looks a little stuck here. rooted to the crease and prodding to point, needs to find a way to get naeem on strike",2

25368,8.04E+11,39.6," dockrell finishes an excellent spell as he started, with a maiden. he's a hugely promising young man and no doubt the england selectors will be keeping an eye!",0
25369,8.04E+11,39.5," ooh, lucky here for the batsman as he swishes hard, bottom edges and the ball goes this far over the stumps",0
25370,8.04E+11,39.3, shafiul hanging back and swishing without much fortune outside off,0
25371,8.04E+11,39.2," again the length is good, again the line is good, again the flight is good. what's a batsman to do",0
25372,8.04E+11,39.1," dockrell to bowl -999 then, throws this -999 up, lands it -999 a perfect length and line and quietly defended",0
25373,8.04E+11,38.6," flash outside off stump again, this time there is an edge but with no slip in place it flies -999 for another boundary. poor old rankin is having a tough game",8
25374,8.04E+11,38.5," big swish outside off stump, big miss too",8
25375,8.04E+11,38.4," this is driven hard, but straight to mid-off",8
25376,8.04E+11,38.3," much needed boundary, but it's needed a horrid misfield from johnston to get it, sliding to the ball and letting it through him",8
25377,8.04E+11,38.1," not even in the frame! pushed to mid-on, aggressive fielding, -999-handed pick up and under-arm and raqibul has to go! replays show he was at least -999 feets short of the crease, another careless way to go, and ireland have this game by the scruff now",8
25378,8.04E+11,36.6," short, and pulled hard -999 to midwicket",3
25379,8.04E+11,36.5, turned to backward square with a flick of the wrists. another -999 to the cause,3

25384,8.04E+11,25.6," good ball to finish a good over, thrown up, hint of spin, blocked to mid-off",4
25385,8.04E+11,25.5, worked into the leg side for another -999. decent stuff from bowler and batsman,4
25386,8.04E+11,25.4," poor delivery, far too short but the bounce is so low and the pitch so slow that it seems impossible to find the boundary",4
25387,8.04E+11,25.3," good flight here, accurate as well and it's milked down the ground",4
25388,8.04E+11,25.2," picked off to midwicket, neatly played",4
25389,8.04E+11,25.1," anyway, with the new ball dockrell finds a typically good length and line and is prodded into the leg side",4
25390,8.04E+11,23.6, batsman will be annoyed with this. dragged down a touch short but the lack of pace in the pitch meant the cut shot came off the toe-end and trickled to point,2
25391,8.04E+11,23.5," lovely delivery, some flight and dip, hint of spin and mushfiqur very respectful in defence",2
25392,8.04E+11,23.4, this is worked into space for another -999,2
25393,8.04E+11,23.3," 'down, down!' screams o'brien. despite a dive dockrell couldn't reach it though and a -999 milked back past him",2
25394,8.04E+11,23.2, mushfiqur is down on the sweep and almost makes a hash of it as it bobbles off a flurry of arms and bat,2
25395,8.04E+11,23.1," ah spin here for dockrell, enough to check the drive from mushfiqur",2
25396,8.04E+11,22.6, blocked back to the bowler to end a good comeback over for johnston,2
25397,8.04E+11,22.5, enough room to flash a cut shot -999 to deep point,2
25398,8.04E+11,22.4," very straight, good length too and mushfiqur's punch is neatly collected by the bowler",2
25399,8.04E+11,22.3, hint of width but it keeps low and finds the toe-end of a flat-footed slash outside off stump,2
25400,8.04E+11,22.2," no bounce here and mushfiqur, hanging on the crease, has to jab his bat down in defence",2
25401,8.04E+11,22.1," not a great start to the new spell, fired down the leg side. worked to fine leg for an easy -999",2
25402,8.04E+11,19.6," ah, that mushfiqur sweep! down low and smashing a sweep to deep midwicket",5
25403,8.04E+11,19.5," -999 picked off into space, again raqibul playing off the back foot",5
25404,8.04E+11,19.4, just been a bit short this over dockrell. raqibul deep in his crease to defend,5
25405,8.04E+11,19.3, touch too short again and mushfiqur cuts to deep point,5
25406,8.04E+11,19.2," first run off dockrell, turned into the leg side",5
25407,8.04E+11,19.1," touch too short from dockrell, raqibul rocks back but picks -999 cover with his drive",5
25408,8.04E+11,17.6, maiden over to begin dockrell's world cup career. excellent over it was too. the man will be an england legend in no time,0
25409,8.04E+11,17.5," back to a fullish length, touch of flight from an easy action, careful defence once more",0
25410,8.04E+11,17.4, touch shorter this time but mushfiqur can't time his cut shot,0
25411,8.04E+11,17.3," first the flight, now the turn! ripper from dockrell, landing around leg and spinning towards the outside edge",0
25412,8.04E+11,17.2," excellent length and line again, nothing for the batsman but defence",0
25413,8.04E+11,17.1," wonderful start, thrown up, dipping, landing around off stump and defended carefully",0
25414,8.04E+11,14.6, nurdled -999 to point,6
25415,8.04E+11,14.5," dropped! just when -999 was praising their fielding, porterfield drops a clanger at point! a regulation cut, it seemed to reach him before he was set, and the chance was lost ... his reaction suggests he never saw it -999 of the crowd.",6
25416,8.04E+11,14.4," defended -999 to midwicket, a hip-high delivery",6
25417,8.04E+11,14.4," round the -999, and rankin overcompensates with the angle, that fizzes down leg",6
25418,8.04E+11,14.3," a chopped cut shot, straight to the fielder at point",6
25419,8.04E+11,14.2," punched off the back foot, sharp fielding in the covers again. ireland have been tigerish, to borrow their opponents' favourite animal",6
25420,8.04E+11,14.1," that's -999 of them already ... the extra pace, and extra bounce, work in the batsman's favour. enough width to attack and that streaks through point",6
25421,8.04E+11,11.6, pushed down to long-off to complete the over. this is nip-and-tuck now!,5
25422,8.04E+11,11.5," sweet shot, just a fraction over-pitched, and shakib leant into a straight drive, all weight transferral, minimum power. nice",5
25423,8.04E+11,11.4," a swish from deep in the crease, midwicket tidies up without alarm",5
25424,8.04E+11,11.3, shakib stands tall on the back foot to drive into the covers,5
25425,8.04E+11,11.2," on the toes, flicked to square leg",5
25426,8.04E+11,11.1," the silence is absolutely deafening, as tamim drives a bit lazily outside off stump, and the skipper porterfield leans forward at point to take the most crucial -999 of the day so far!",5
25427,8.04E+11,7.6, given this was a shin-high full toss johnston is luck to get -999 wit it. quietly prodded to deep square. decent mini-period for the irish here,3
25428,8.04E+11,7.5, the pitch seems a touch slow and tamim's back-foot punch finds cover here,3
25429,8.04E+11,7.4," junaid is -999, full-facing a -999 down the ground",3
25430,8.04E+11,7.3," much fuller this time, almost yorker length, turned to deep midwicket for a quiet -999",3
25431,8.04E+11,7.2, back of a length and tamim offers the straightest of blades in defence,3
25432,8.04E+11,7.1," johnston finds an off stump line, he also finds the middle of tamim's bat but it goes straight to cover",3
25433,8.04E+11,12.6," moves in towards the middle and leg, again looking for lbw, but misbah ensures his front foot doesn't come in the way as he tucks the ball to square-leg",6
25434,8.04E+11,12.5," younis trapped lbw. he charges up to kamran, has a chat, and asks for udrs. it was a full delivery on the middle, tilting in towards middle and leg. younis played all around it and would have lost the leg stump. -999 down and wobbling. what a start this by canada.",6
25435,8.04E+11,12.4, drags this -999 short and younis pulls - he doesn't quite time it well but manages to drag it wider and over mid-on,6
25436,8.04E+11,12.3, runs this down to third man for a -999,6
25437,8.04E+11,12.2, gets forward to defend to the on side,6
25438,8.04E+11,12.1," what a lovely inswinger! full in length and it curved in the air. kamran stumbled -999 and was beaten on the drive, as he went too much inside the line",6
25439,8.04E+11,7.6," full delivery on the middle and leg, curves towards middle, driven down the track",6
25440,8.04E+11,7.5," almost a catch but it's a -999! kamran flicked uppishly and it almost carried to the sub at short fine-leg. he didn't move forward, tried to lunge -999 but it fell short and ran past him",6
25441,8.04E+11,7.4," full in length outside off, driven wide of mid-off for a -999",6
25442,8.04E+11,7.3," in the channel outside off, left alone",6

25444,8.04E+11,7.2, gets behind the line to defend to the off side,6
25445,8.04E+11,7.1," wide delivery outside off, he tries to carve it through the off side but can't reach the ball",6
25446,8.04E+11,6.6, gets forward and across to drive to cover,1
25447,8.04E+11,6.5," in the zone outside off, left alone",1
25448,8.04E+11,6.4, gets behind the line to defend to the off side,1
25449,8.04E+11,6.4, sprays this wide down the leg side.,1
25450,8.04E+11,6.3," short in length, closer to the off, kamran stands on his toes to punch it to point",1
25451,8.04E+11,6.2," short and wide again, kamran cuts it straight to point",1
25452,8.04E+11,6.1," short and wide, cut to point",1
25453,8.04E+11,4.6," offers width outside off and short as well, shehzad cuts hard but point intercepts",4
25454,8.04E+11,4.5, takes a couple of steps down the track and the bowler drags back the length; shehzad defends,4
25455,8.04E+11,4.4, he bowls this fuller but he tries to take it the other way and ends up with no swing. it's an overpitched delivery in the end and shehzad creams it to left of mid-off,4
25456,8.04E+11,4.3, again movement in from short of length and that allows shahzad to sit back and push it to the on side,4
25457,8.04E+11,4.2," hint of inswing and shahzad gets behind the line to tap it to the on side. good delivery that. can he hurl it a tad fuller, though?",4
25458,8.04E+11,4.1, stays back to defend a short-of-length delivery towards mid-offf,4
25459,8.04E+11,3.6," short and wide, kamran reaches -999 to mistime his cut shot. the ball rolls to point",0
25460,8.04E+11,3.5, taps this to the left of backward point for a -999,0
25461,8.04E+11,3.4," well outside the off stump, kamran watches it sail through to the keeper",0
25462,8.04E+11,3.3," in the zone outside off, kamran thinks about having a go but decides to withdraw his bat at the last instant",0
25463,8.04E+11,3.2," lands on a good length outside off and moves in towards middle, defended on the back foot",0
25464,8.04E+11,3.1, given -999 and hafeez goes for udrs. lbw. it landed on a good length outside off stump and moved in to hit the pad above the knee roll in front of leg and middle stump. the height was in question. and would it have hit the leg stump? hawk eye says it would have clipped the top of the leg stump. and that has been given -999.,0
25465,8.04E+11,41.3, left alone outside off stump,7
25466,8.04E+11,41.2," pietersen switches to around the -999, again no great spin here and steyn works around the corner",7
25467,8.04E+11,41.1, van wky drops with the softest of hands to cover to steal a -999. not the exploding turn there was before for pietersen,7
25468,8.04E+11,36.6," that's the -999! outside off, peterson drives flat-footedly, prior clings on, and now england really are favourites!",0
25469,8.04E+11,36.5," there was width on that -999 and peterson had a swipe,  but couldn't cash in!",0
25470,8.04E+11,36.4," loud shouts from the close fielders, full length and tight line.",0
25471,8.04E+11,36.3," a fraction shorter, but straight enough. mid-on gathers with a tumble",0
25472,8.04E+11,36.2, over the -999 to the left-hander. blocked to cover,0
25473,8.04E+11,36.1," short and hittable, driven to point",0
25474,8.04E+11,30.6, defended on the back foot,3
25475,8.04E+11,30.5," good shot to a decent ball, an urgent cramped cut, but places it well. decent running to get du plessis on strike",3
25476,8.04E+11,30.4," tossed up again, played straight back down the track",3
25477,8.04E+11,30.3," well bowled again, open face to another big turner, and lucky to get -999 with it",3
25478,8.04E+11,30.2," good delivery, sharp turn and beats the edge of a loose drive",3
25479,8.04E+11,30.1, tossed onto the leg stump,3
25480,8.04E+11,28.6," ah, wonderful shot with pressure just beginning to build. du plessis hops to the leg side to give himself room and threads a perfectly-timed drive between mid-off and extra cover",6
25481,8.04E+11,28.5, spin here finds a leading edge that heads -999  to cover,6
25482,8.04E+11,28.4," ankle-high bounce here, hint of spin too and du plessis looked hurried in defence",6
25483,8.04E+11,28.3," flat, no great turn but the line is adequate. pushed wide of cover",6
25484,8.04E+11,28.2, quietly defended this time from de villiers,6
25485,8.04E+11,28.1, nudged around the corner,6
25486,8.04E+11,27.6, solid and secure forward defence to end the maiden over.,0
25487,8.04E+11,27.5," very similar delivery, no room for de villiers to free his arms at and blocked again. bresnan needs a strong finish",0
25488,8.04E+11,27.4," de villiers' bat here is almost as straight as the delivery, pushing to mid-off",0
25489,8.04E+11,27.3," bresnan hitting a fullish length around middle and off, nothing for the batsman to work with",0
25490,8.04E+11,27.2," prodded into the leg side, du plessis came a long way up in search of a -999, before slamming on the breaks, turning and haring back",0
25491,8.04E+11,27.1," tight line and length, no swing on offer here and calmly negotiated",0
25492,8.04E+11,26.6, good over finishes with an inside edge that goes onto pad and loop -999 of the reach of slip,1
25493,8.04E+11,26.5," swept, and swept hard to deep square. excellent over from pietersen, nothing dragged down short",1
25494,8.04E+11,26.4, again pietersen finds a length and line and nothing on offer,1
25495,8.04E+11,26.3, plenty of turn again but de villiers is more secure in defence,1
25496,8.04E+11,26.2, de villiers aims a reverse-sweep which he doesn't get near connecting. draws plenty of ooohs from the england fielders,1
25497,8.04E+11,26.1," this spins again swiftly, jagging back and bouncing from outside off",1
25498,8.04E+11,22.6, gentle appeal from the bowler mainly as this thuds off the pad on its way to anderson at slip. who was not at all interested,5
25499,8.04E+11,22.5, this is pushed -999 into space,5
25500,8.04E+11,22.4," de villiers rushes across to the off side to spoon this towards fine leg, very swift running turned a tight -999 into a secure couple",5
25501,8.04E+11,22.3," stronger shot this time, solidly pushed wide of mid-on",5
25502,8.04E+11,22.2, du plessis advances but can't catch up with this delivery and has to hurriedly work to leg,5
25503,8.04E+11,22.1," swept carefully, with a bit of bottom edge around the corner",5
25504,8.04E+11,18.6, blocked into the off side. swann is running -999 of overs,2
25505,8.04E+11,18.5," jabbed to midwicket, swann is looking less of a threat without a left-hander to torment",2
25506,8.04E+11,18.4," forward with bat and pad, defended to cover",2
25507,8.04E+11,18.3," slow spin from outside off, defended back to the bowler to a shout of 'yes swanny'",2
25508,8.04E+11,18.2, squeezed into the leg side again,2
25509,8.04E+11,18.1," forward in a clatter of limbs, worked to midwicket",2
25510,8.04E+11,5.6, similar delivery but smith was content this time to run a -999 to third man,2
25511,8.04E+11,5.5," bresnan is lucky to get -999 with this, touch short and wide but smith didn't time his clump",2
25512,8.04E+11,5.4, tucked -999 into the midwicket region,2
25513,8.04E+11,5.3," ooh, strangled appeal from someone, not the bowler though, as amla swishes across the line and misses",2
25514,8.04E+11,5.2," amla is a touch late on this. bresnan is actually quite brisk. quicker than you think, heavy ball, hits the bat hard and assorted other cliches",2
25515,8.04E+11,5.1," starts well straight -999, pushing up on a length and beating amla's work to leg",2
25516,8.04E+11,3.6, back of a length again to finish the over. amla stands tall and defends to midwicket,7
25517,8.04E+11,3.5, smith will forever pick singles off his pads,7
25518,8.04E+11,3.4," better delivery this time, hammered back of length and around off stump. smith tried to heave a pull shot but it was through him too swiftly",7
25519,8.04E+11,3.3," poor ball, real horrible -999. wide down the leg side, all smith had to do was get a faint tickle, he got plenty and fine leg had no chance",7
25520,8.04E+11,3.2, width allows amla to fling his hands at this and it skids down to third man,7
25521,8.04E+11,3.1," anderson aims full, going across the left hander. finds a thick outside edge than runs down to third man",7
25522,8.04E+11,6.6," again a hint of drift, eric reads it well this time, doesn't get too far across and flicks from the leg stump line where it lands. a couple of runs, harbhajan is unhappy with the effort. nehra was the man at deep midwicket. a mismatch of expectations?",4
25523,8.04E+11,6.5," the -999 that goes straight, back of a length and eric plays back to defend into the off side",4
25524,8.04E+11,6.4," barresi paddles from outside off, nicely controlled shot wide of leg slip for -999",4
25525,8.04E+11,6.3," eric jumps -999, almost yorks himself but manages to work with the spin through wide mid on",4
25526,8.04E+11,6.2," drift for harbhajan, nearly foxes eric there as he curls it from wide of the crease towards middle and leg. eric flicks too early and the leading edge pops up to the right of the pitch",4
25527,8.04E+11,6.1," flighted on off stump, eric reaches -999 and works it to the leg side",4
25528,8.04E+11,5.6," yusuf has a maiden, getting -999 to drift from off to middle and leg, it is worked with the spin to leg slip",0
25529,8.04E+11,5.5," he strolls -999 again, but yusuf cannily holds the length back and forces him to inside edge the force down the ground",0
25530,8.04E+11,5.4," tossed up outside off, barresi leans -999 and defends to the off side",0
25531,8.04E+11,5.3," this time on middle and leg, barresi plays with the spin to the leg side",0
25532,8.04E+11,5.2," aha, barresi skips -999 but can't reach the flight and inside edges the loft onto the pad",0
25533,8.04E+11,5.1," tossed up outside off, barresi gets to the pitch and defends to the off side",0
25534,8.04E+11,3.6," on off stump to end the over, no width on offer from yusuf, and barresi defends back down the track",2
25535,8.04E+11,3.5," again turning into the pads, eric tucks it backward of square leg and gets -999",2
25536,8.04E+11,3.4," on leg stump again, eric looks to play softly to the on side and finds midwicket",2
25537,8.04E+11,3.3," strays on leg stump, worked off the pads through square leg for -999",2
25538,8.04E+11,3.2, shortens the length on off stump and it is worked back to the bowler,2
25539,8.04E+11,3.1," length ball, turning in from off stump, defended to the off side",2
25540,8.04E+11,1.6," that's the length, nehra lands it a foot shorter than he has through the over, and gets it to slant across barresi, eluding his faint poke, but not by much.",6
25541,8.04E+11,1.5," slow and sluggish start here from nehra. he's once again over-pitched, this time on middle and leg, and barresi has pounced on it with a half step forward and driven crisply to the right of mid off",6
25542,8.04E+11,1.4," full again, barresi presses forward to defend into the off side",6
25543,8.04E+11,1.3," this time barresi finds the gap, he drives with opened wrists to elude the man at short cover, and backward cover point dives -999 to deflect it and keep it to -999. no movement for nehra yet, and he is bowling a foot further than he normall does.",6
25544,8.04E+11,1.2," over-pitched on off stump at 131 kph, nehra is offering them for the drive, but again barresi finds short cover",6

25546,8.04E+11,15.6," goes very full, he is ready and hits it down to long on",7
25547,8.04E+11,15.5, steered -999 to short third man from the crease,7
25548,8.04E+11,15.4," drives inside -999 wide of long off, and a comfortable couple is taken",7
25549,8.04E+11,15.3, worked -999 behind square on the leg side,7
25550,8.04E+11,15.2, blocked with a straight bat down the track,7
25551,8.04E+11,15.1," goes slashing at -999 that was pushed through very quickly and full, it was turning in on off stump, but dilshan went flaying at it, and the outside edge was too fast for short third man",7
25552,8.04E+11,3.6," and almost gets tharanga this time, had him feeling for -999 that was angled across on off stump, tharanga brought down an angled bat, and the inside edge rolled -999 perilously close to the stumps",2
25553,8.04E+11,3.5," good over so far, cramps him for room with -999 on the stumps, pushed -999 in to the leg side",2
25554,8.04E+11,3.4," bit of width outside off stump, he opens the face to guide it to backward point",2
25555,8.04E+11,3.3," again dilshan latches on to -999 that is marginally short, doesn't bounce as much as dilshan expected but he still pulls it -999, there is man at deep midwicket now",2
25556,8.04E+11,3.2," better start from panyangara to the over, fuller now around off and tharanga drives it without power to mid off",2
25557,8.04E+11,3.1," bounces outside off stump from short of a good length, left alone quietly",2
25558,8.04E+11,0.6," dilshan looks for the flailing drive through covers, it is too close to off stump, and he closes the face of the bat to hit it -999 to mid on",6
25559,8.04E+11,0.5," goes straighter now, on the stumps, tharanga shuffles and works it wide of midwicket",6
25560,8.04E+11,0.4," and he is -999 now, gets -999 pitched up and slightly wide outside off, tharanga's zone all the way, gets the foot -999 and sends it between the gap between cover and point",6
25561,8.04E+11,0.3, just around a length and going across tharanga who comes -999 and blocks it towards covers,6
25562,8.04E+11,0.2, comes forward and eases a fuller -999 towards mid off,6
25563,8.04E+11,0.1," and an appeal right -999, some movement from the seam, hits tharanga on the knee roll, umpire says not -999, looked to be a bit high, might have been going down leg",6

25728,8.04E+11,43.1," tossed up outside off stump, he uses the feet well and drives to cover",8
25729,8.04E+11,36.2," flat outside off stump, jayawardene uses the feet well and drives past mid-off for -999 more, this is very easy batting",8
25730,8.04E+11,36.1," tossed up outside off stump, swept hard -999 to deep backward square leg",8
25731,8.04E+11,28.6, sangakkara tries to swipe across the line but only manages a thick inside edge to fine leg for a brace,10
25732,8.04E+11,28.5," slightly slower and full outside off, driven through extra cover for a -999",10
25733,8.04E+11,28.3, wallop! jayawardene backs -999 and slog sweeps way over midwicket for a -999. he's equalled his highest world cup score with that shot,10
25734,8.04E+11,28.2," full outside off, driven crisply through extra cover for a -999",10
25735,8.04E+11,28.1," full ball, driven back to the bowler",10
25736,8.04E+11,19.6," overpitched, jayawardene comes forward and turns it to mid-off, but doesnt chance the -999",5
25737,8.04E+11,19.5," good ball, a yorker almost, but not quite there, and sangakkara jams the bat down and turns it with the wrists for -999 to midwicket",5
25738,8.04E+11,19.4," back of a length on middle and leg, sangakkara shuffles and tucks it into the on side",5
25739,8.04E+11,19.4," he oversteps - hugely - for the over, and sangakkara flicks it to midwicket...count those no-balls, people",5
25740,8.04E+11,19.3," fuller, close to a yorker length, sangakkara shuffles and drives expansively but not timed well and the ball just rolls back to hurdle",5
25741,8.04E+11,19.2," better, better...a good length fractionally outside off stump forces sangakkara to shoulder arms",5
25742,8.04E+11,19.2," bad ball again, very wide of leg stump for the second wide of the over",5
25743,8.04E+11,19.1," good length outside off stump, played late and with soft hands for the -999 down to third man",5
25744,8.04E+11,19.1," a shocker! very, very wide outside off stump",5

25751,8.04E+11,7.6," back of a length on middle and leg, worked to the onside, tucker moves across and does the fielding himself",8
25752,8.04E+11,7.5," good length outside off stump, pushed to cover",8
25753,8.04E+11,7.4," short and wide, jayasuriya chops it to point and cann again throws himself to the right, full stretch, and saves -999",8
25754,8.04E+11,7.3," good length outside off stump, tharanga stands rooted and flashes the bat it, getting a thick-edge that pops up over point and lands in the deep, batsmen hurry for -999, good work by cann and romaine to haul it in",8
25755,8.04E+11,7.2," moving delivery outside off stump, beats the outside edge again",8
25756,8.04E+11,7.1," full and wide, tharanga stands rooted and chases it, getting a thick outside edge that flies well over the man at short third man for -999",8
25757,8.04E+11,6.6," beaten! a fuller, swinging delivery outside off stump, beats jayasuriya's forward prod and minors appeals, but not the bowler",5
25758,8.04E+11,6.5," short of a length outside off stump again, he hops and square-drives off the backfoot -999 to deep point",5
25759,8.04E+11,6.4," back of a length well outside off stump, tharanga watches it into minor's gloves",5
25760,8.04E+11,6.3," short of a length outside off stump, he gets up and drives off the backfoot to mid-off",5
25761,8.04E+11,6.2," here he goes! that was in the slot outside off stump and he picks it up over mid-on, ball lands and stops and the batsmen have to settle for -999",5
25762,8.04E+11,6.1," back of a length on off stump, he gets behind it and pushes down the ground, mid-off comes across and fields",5
25763,8.04E+11,6.1," full and wide, moving -999, called a wide",5
25764,8.04E+11,3.6," good length ball outside off stump, he stands and defends to the off side",4

25766,8.04E+11,3.4," lands on middle and leg, tucked to square leg",4
25767,8.04E+11,3.3," fuller, slight movement into him, tucked past short fine leg with no hassles",4
25768,8.04E+11,3.2, lands on middle and leg and he works that through square leg with ease,4
25769,8.04E+11,3.1," not too good, angled down the pads and tharanga clips it down to fine leg, umpire signals leg-byes",4
25770,8.04E+11,28.6, pushed -999 to cover and there's a -999 maiden,0
25771,8.04E+11,28.5," just short of a length and again the batsman refuses to take a risk, just defending it",0
25772,8.04E+11,28.4, defended solidly,0
25773,8.04E+11,28.3," good line just outside off, forcing the defensive",0
25774,8.04E+11,28.2," beaten! the arm-ball...very well bowled, passing by an indecisive forward poke",0
25775,8.04E+11,28.1," gone! played off the back foot and neatly timed, but he's too far back in his crease and treads on his stumps!",0
25776,8.04E+11,20.6," on off stump, cutting back into him and he stands tall to defend",3
25777,8.04E+11,20.5," goddim! it was short and wide, deserved to be hit - but he could only loft it to mid off who took a simple catch",3
25778,8.04E+11,20.4," straighter, too straight, and it's turned around the corner",3
25779,8.04E+11,20.3, cutting back into the right-hander who defends,3
25780,8.04E+11,20.2, defended on the front foot,3
25781,8.04E+11,20.1," and he comes down the pitch, a shimmy, but decides against lofting it, instead whipping the ball to mid-on",3
25782,8.04E+11,15.6, a fine over ends with another on-target delivery,0
25783,8.04E+11,15.5, botha keeps a tight line and all sibanda can do is push to point,0
25784,8.04E+11,15.4, takes the pads into the on side,0
25785,8.04E+11,15.3," punched into the covers, the vocal niall o'brien screams 'who's on it'...someone is",0
25786,8.04E+11,15.2, cut -999 but brilliantly fielded by white in the gully to prevent any runs,0
25787,8.04E+11,15.1, full toss and sibanda misses -999 by finding cover with his drive,0
25788,8.04E+11,9.6," good end to the over, finding -999 to rise on the batsman who nevertheless plays it neatly off the back foot",7
25789,8.04E+11,9.5," and he tries to work this around the corner, but misses -999",7
25790,8.04E+11,9.4," better ball, fuller and straighter and defended",7
25791,8.04E+11,9.3, and again he pulls this over square leg for -999,7
25792,8.04E+11,9.2," oh dear, commentators' kiss of death again. what a shot - remarkably pulled, well in front of square, with tremendous power",7
25793,8.04E+11,9.1," ooh and he's squared up here, the ball spooning into the covers as he tried to work it to leg",7
25794,8.04E+11,8.6," and again drifting down leg, but chibhabha can't make anything of it",2
25795,8.04E+11,8.6, filthy wide outside off,2
25796,8.04E+11,8.5, this angles into chibhabha who plays it softly to leg,2
25797,8.04E+11,8.4," comes forward to defend, rather pushing at it ungainly so but defends it solidly enough",2
25798,8.04E+11,8.3, on middle stump and pushed to leg,2
25799,8.04E+11,8.2, drifting down leg but he can't connect with it,2
25800,8.04E+11,8.1, firmly and crisply driven back to the bowler,2
25801,8.04E+11,7.6, cracked off the back foot,14
25802,8.04E+11,7.5," better shot; lofted with power and timing, squarer this time, and porterfield -999 on the extra cover boundary signals that he's saved -999 with a sprawling dive...",14
25803,8.04E+11,7.4," bashed down the ground, aerially, to the bowler's left, through long off and it just bobbles over the line",14
25804,8.04E+11,7.4," drifts this further down leg and, this time, it's a wide",14
25805,8.04E+11,7.3," full, but drifting down leg - yet the batsman can't make anything of it, missing -999 on an easy flick down to fine leg",14
25806,8.04E+11,7.2," and he goes for an expansive cover drive but gets an inside edge, somehow evading his stumps and also evading o'brien's dive behind the stumps",14
25807,8.04E+11,7.1, defended on the back foot,14
25808,8.04E+11,5.6," gone! goddim! third time lucky for rankin, as duffin edges another excellent delivery straight to o'brien who, this time, doesn't have to move a muscle",0
25809,8.04E+11,5.5," dropped - oh dear, that was village from eoin morgan. a straightforward outside edge, straight to him at second slip who was never in a position to take the catch",0
25810,8.04E+11,5.4," and again it spits up on duffin who plays it very well, with high, soft hands, angling it into the gully",0
25811,8.04E+11,5.3," good length from rankin again, the ball rising from just short of a good length",0
25812,8.04E+11,5.2, defended on the front foot,0
25813,8.04E+11,5.1," dropped - on middle stump before cutting -999 from duffin, who followed it, edging it to o'brien who shelled a simple chance to his left",0
25814,8.04E+11,49.6," well, well! goes across his stumps and tries to sweep past short fine-leg but it only goes as far as the man on the edge of the circle and it's a -999 to finish with",5
25815,8.04E+11,49.5," low full toss, angling into the pads and it's jabbed -999 to cover",5
25816,8.04E+11,49.4," squeezed -999, brings up the 200",5
25817,8.04E+11,49.3," pinpoint yorker, driven up the ground to long off",5
25818,8.04E+11,49.2," full, outside off stump, driven to backward point",5
25819,8.04E+11,49.1," good yorker, on off stump, straight back to the bowler",5
25820,8.04E+11,45.6," decides to go through the leg side this time, but a brilliant save from midwicket prevents any runs",5
25821,8.04E+11,45.5," nearly a yorker, well dug -999 on leg stump",5
25822,8.04E+11,45.4, well hit...picked the slower ball and went over cover. he may not locate the middle very often but when he does it goes a long way...and he has a license in the final few overs,5
25823,8.04E+11,45.3," quicker, shorter...chigumbura tries to pull but gets nowhere near the ball and falls over as he swings himself off his feet...taylor saying 'drive that'",5
25824,8.04E+11,45.2," tries to mow this through the covers, connects well but it's well stopped at cover by samuels",5
25825,8.04E+11,45.1," tries to turn to the on side, gets a leading edge but it falls safe into the off side",5
25826,8.04E+11,44.6," cut hard, through cover and to the daren powell on the boundary",9
25827,8.04E+11,44.5, nudged to point,9
25828,8.04E+11,44.4," pushed down the leg side and delicately played down to fine-leg off the face of the bat and good runnings brings them back for -999, good work though from chanderpaul on the rope",9
25829,8.04E+11,44.3, pulled down to long on,9
25830,8.04E+11,44.2," but thumps this over extra cover in no uncertain terms, -999 of the best shots of the day as he lifts it over the man at cover",9
25831,8.04E+11,44.1, strangely opts not to play this,9
25832,8.04E+11,40.6," poor calling - a mix-up, taylor stranded mid-pitch running from the non-striker's end after the dab down to point. there was never a run there, but taylor didn't wait for the call and set off, to his ultimate cost",2
25833,8.04E+11,40.5, driven back to the bowler,2
25834,8.04E+11,40.4, wide down off and the batsman slashes a cut over that -999 - connecting with air only,2
25835,8.04E+11,40.3, driven to the covers,2
25836,8.04E+11,40.2," worked to square and that's his fifty, a painstaking -999, but well deserved, his 11th odi fifty",2
25837,8.04E+11,40.1, hit to jerome taylor behind point and he changes his mind about the end - throwing to the bowler's instead,2
25838,8.04E+11,39.6, pops that wide of gayle and that's the end of the bowler's spell,4
25839,8.04E+11,39.5," pushed into the covers and there's another risky -999, but it's well taken in the end and even a direct hit wouldn't have had an effect this time",4
25840,8.04E+11,39.4, into the covers now,4
25841,8.04E+11,39.3," onto his back foot and pressed down, tidily",4
25842,8.04E+11,39.2, driven to long-on,4
25843,8.04E+11,39.1, stands tall and nudges a -999 to long-on,4
25844,8.04E+11,33.6, on a good length this time and the batsman can only defend forward,3
25845,8.04E+11,33.5, on leg and that's tucked into space around midwicket,3
25846,8.04E+11,33.4," short, width, and smashed off the back foot with a cut",3
25847,8.04E+11,33.3, turned round with a pull shot to square,3
25848,8.04E+11,33.2, worked off the back foot to cover,3
25849,8.04E+11,33.1, driven to mid-on,3
25850,8.04E+11,21.6," -999 to lara at midwicket, -999 of more rapid (in terms of time) maidens you will ever see",0
25851,8.04E+11,21.5," can't find any gaps, gayle bowling quickly",0
25852,8.04E+11,21.4, back to the bowler,0
25853,8.04E+11,21.3, worked to lara for the third time,0
25854,8.04E+11,21.2," again midwicket into action, good diving save by brian lara",0
25855,8.04E+11,21.1, punched -999 to midwicket,0
25856,8.04E+11,18.6, more back-foot defence as williams takes his time to play himself in and get used to the conditions,1
25857,8.04E+11,18.5, defended on the back foot,1
25858,8.04E+11,18.4, worked down to wide third man,1
25859,8.04E+11,18.3," sturdy defence, with his bat well angled down, and played on the front foot",1
25860,8.04E+11,18.2," decent delivery, a slight arc -999, and that's well left by taylor",1
25861,8.04E+11,18.1, worked into midwicket,1
25862,8.04E+11,17.6, full and that's well dug -999,1
25863,8.04E+11,17.5," a quiet start for williams, working that down off the back foot into the covers",1
25864,8.04E+11,17.4, the first sign of aggression from matsikenyeri and it doesn't come off - looking to strike that over mid-on but it hardly gets up whatsoever and that's an easy catch for daren powell at chest height,1
25865,8.04E+11,17.3," steps down the track, but not -999 of his crease, and defends that -999 forward",1
25866,8.04E+11,17.2," a touch of width and that's cut - without much room for his arms, a short-arm cut if that makes sense - to point",1
25867,8.04E+11,17.1, defended forward,1
25868,8.04E+11,15.6," dabbed down to gully and that would have been close for matsikenyeri with a direct hit, but he made his ground easily in the end",7
25869,8.04E+11,15.5, played off the toes to the man at short midwicket,7
25870,8.04E+11,15.4," left alone outside off, quiet leave that -999",7
25871,8.04E+11,15.4," oh dear, a loose shot to a loose delivery down off - and that's a wide, in fact",7
25872,8.04E+11,15.4, down off,7
25873,8.04E+11,15.3," tucked off the legs through the on-side, a nice shot, and there's just a hint of momentum building into the zimbabwe innings",7
25874,8.04E+11,15.2, driven forward,7
25875,8.04E+11,15.1, poked down behind gully,7
25876,8.04E+11,11.6," short, straight and that's played down off the back foot to a very wide third man, more of a fifth man",5
25877,8.04E+11,11.5, on leg and that's worked to short midwicket,5
25878,8.04E+11,11.4," the ball comes back sharply and there's a big appeal and that's going down leg, with a touch of inside edge, too",5
25879,8.04E+11,11.3, fizzes through and that's left alone outside off stump with some serious shouldering of arms,5
25880,8.04E+11,11.2," oh - wide delivery, seaming off the pitch, the batsman slashes at that -999 and a thick edge flies wide of second slip, and climbing, and that runs -999 very quickly indeed",5
25881,8.04E+11,11.1, short and gently arcing -999 from the righthander there who lets it fly through to the keeper,5
25882,8.04E+11,9.6," sharp bouncer, but ducks underneath without too much trouble. good over for west indies",1
25883,8.04E+11,9.5, solidly blocked back to the bowler,1
25884,8.04E+11,9.4," moves -999 off the seam, no shot offered",1
25885,8.04E+11,9.3, drifting onto the hips and it's glanced down to fine leg,1
25886,8.04E+11,9.2," that's why no -999 went up, he was planning on cleaning him up next ball! full and straight, chibhabha beaten for pace and gets nowhere near it, zimbabwe in further trouble after a promising stand",1
25887,8.04E+11,9.1," full, on middle, trapped between bat and pad and rolls back to the bowler...replays show it was pad first but no -999 appealed",1
25888,8.04E+11,5.6," slightly better, but still no need to play and a long over comes to end",6
25889,8.04E+11,5.6," oh dear, again, and the bowlers really losing the plot at the moment, perhaps trying too hard after the early wickets",6
25890,8.04E+11,5.6," another wide, and this will be a problem for west indies if they don't tighten up",6
25891,8.04E+11,5.5, back to the bowler,6
25892,8.04E+11,5.4," back of a length, forced off the back foot off half the bat down to third man who is the busiest fielder at the moment",6
25893,8.04E+11,5.4," drifting well down the leg side, west indies letting themselves down despite the early wickets",6
25894,8.04E+11,5.3," full, searching for the swing and it threatens to move as it takes the outside edge down to third man",6
25895,8.04E+11,5.2, gets across his stumps and works backward of square,6
25896,8.04E+11,5.1, punched firmly to mid off,6
25897,8.04E+11,3.6, pushed back into his crease and nudged into the on side,3
25898,8.04E+11,3.5," plays this -999 well, soft hands off the front foot and squeezes it past gully down to third man",3
25899,8.04E+11,3.4," flashy! goes for the cut, but not enough width and the batsmen doing their best to find the edge",3
25900,8.04E+11,3.3," played off the back foot, down towards back point",3
25901,8.04E+11,3.3," way down the leg side, loose -999 from taylor and very well gathered by ramdin who has looked sharp early on with the gloves",3
25902,8.04E+11,3.2," straightens on middle and met with a solid, straight bat",3
25903,8.04E+11,3.1," bat and pad into the on side, he looks an lbw candidate the way he falls across his stumps",3
25904,8.04E+11,1.6," pushes forward, ball goes past the edge and another fine over. both new-ball bowlers are right on the money from off today, making life tough for the zimbabwe batsmen",2
25905,8.04E+11,1.5," loose drive and a thick outside flies down to third man through the gully, first run off the bat but not very convincing",2
25906,8.04E+11,1.4, zimbabwe -999 with a leg-bye as he takes the thigh pad and goes down to long leg. not sure there was a shot played at that but the umpire rules it was evasive action,2
25907,8.04E+11,1.3, nearly another! chibhabha goes fishing at an 85mph (136kph) outswinger and it almost takes the edge,2
25908,8.04E+11,1.2, gets behind this with a straight bat,2
25909,8.04E+11,1.1," and he only lasts -999 ball! full inswinger from taylor and that would have been too much for better players. kasteni was late on it, played all around the ball and it crashed into off stump. great start for west indies",2
25910,8.04E+11,7.6," short and off side and bray, given the room to free his arms, smacks that over the covers and it's -999 all the way",4
25911,8.04E+11,7.5," outside off, another mow from bray which misses",4
25912,8.04E+11,7.4," short, this time bray sways -999 the way and lets it pass",4
25913,8.04E+11,7.3, body-line again ( as opposed to bodyline) and once more bray cannot cope with it. it's through him and he ends up off balance and the ball lobs off his thigh to slip,4
25914,8.04E+11,7.2," into bray's body, an area where he looks far from happy, the ball hits him on the thigh pad, bray briefly looks for a leg bye but it was never on as powell races through to pick it up",4
25915,8.04E+11,7.1," short, bray shapes to hook/uppercut but that's too high for even him and he ends up with his bat high above him like an aerial.",4
25916,8.04E+11,1.6," outside off- fired across morgan at 89.5mph, and he leaves alone",4
25917,8.04E+11,1.5," morgan back and into line, all very correct and safe",4
25918,8.04E+11,1.4, through morgan for pace - 86.9mph - although headed down the leg,4
25919,8.04E+11,1.3," leg-stump line, morgan shimmies to the off and the ball flicks his pads and runs very fine, no chance of anyone catching that",4
25920,8.04E+11,1.2," again a tad short, this time porterfield tried to get over it but it was too big for him and an edge flew to gayle at firstslip ... regulation catch at chest height, and that's porterfield's second duck in -999 matches",4
25921,8.04E+11,1.1," good line, a fraction short, and porterfield plays inside the line quite deliberately",4
25922,8.04E+11,30.6," on leg stump, and worked through midwicket",13
25923,8.04E+11,30.5," again too wide, ponting goes for it and misses",13
25924,8.04E+11,30.4," pushed on the front foot to mid-off. a much better length here from mahmood, albeit on a line far, far too wide once again",13
25925,8.04E+11,30.4, down the leg side and that'll be a wide,13
25926,8.04E+11,30.3," pumped to strauss at deep extra cover for a -999. oh no, strauss makes a complete hash of it and they grab -999",13
25927,8.04E+11,30.2," and there's his 60th fifty from 69 balls, as he knocks this leg-side drifter down for another -999",13
25928,8.04E+11,30.1," thrashed - absolutely laced behind point for -999. you just do not, and cannot, bowl short and wide - to anyone - but least of all ponting. least of all in a world cup, in a crunch match - never mind on a pitch this flat. terrible bowling",13
25929,8.04E+11,27.6," slower delivery, outside off, and that's driven slowly into the covers. 'no!' doubt whether they're going to take a -999 or not",8
25930,8.04E+11,27.5," straight, up there, and that's driven -999 to long-off",8
25931,8.04E+11,27.4," well swished off the hips but there's some great teamwork on the boundary, anderson sliding to keep the ball in and pietersen winging it back",8
25932,8.04E+11,27.4," an attempted stumping from an off-side wide. a bit harsh the wide, you'd suspect, but no doubt on the fact that ponting's foot was firmly grounded",8
25933,8.04E+11,27.3, a hint of inswing there and ponting plays that into his leg,8
25934,8.04E+11,27.2, defended down off the back foot this time,8
25935,8.04E+11,27.1," waited and waited and flicked it with his wrists down to fine leg. the ball wheezes over the line in the end, much like a marathon runner",8
25936,8.04E+11,24.6," hit firmly through midwicket, nice shot, that",4
25937,8.04E+11,24.5," clarke comes down the track before anderson releases, short -999 and he misses -999, trying to pull that, but it clatters straight into his thigh off the edge and they eke -999 a -999",4
25938,8.04E+11,24.4," tricks that -999 off leg, it's a bit short too, with a lovely clip to midwicket",4
25939,8.04E+11,24.3, drives that -999 -999 to mid-off and the call is a clear 'no!',4
25940,8.04E+11,24.2," more of the good stuff, this -999 straight and up there, and ponting works that to mid-on, thinking of the -999, but deciding against it in the end",4
25941,8.04E+11,24.1," thinks about driving that -999 on the up, but in the end he has to defend",4
25942,8.04E+11,21.6," back to where he started this over, on a good line and awkward length and that's just defended forward",2
25943,8.04E+11,21.5," good line this time, on off, but drags it a touch short and that's driven to mid-on",2
25944,8.04E+11,21.4," straighter, but overcompensates with the line, allowing ponting to nibble that -999 down off his hips just in front of square for an easy -999",2
25945,8.04E+11,21.3," width this time and ponting should have cashed in. instead, he short changes himself with a drive straight to cover",2
25946,8.04E+11,21.2," again on an awkward length, just tucking ponting up on line with off, and he fends down",2
25947,8.04E+11,21.1," no great pace, of course, but he places that -999 on a good length and ponting can't get it -999",2
25948,8.04E+11,18.6," a huge appeal from flintoff who is absolutely convinced he has ponting leg before, but replays indicate the ball was just going over the top. and he was outside the line, too. not -999, then",1
25949,8.04E+11,18.5," good line again, and ponting refuses to be tempted into driving",1
25950,8.04E+11,18.4," again it's watchfully defended by ponting to a ball just outside his off stump. good, nagging line this",1
25951,8.04E+11,18.3," straighter delivery this time, and ponting bat-pads it into the covers",1
25952,8.04E+11,18.2," ah, superbly cut - a late-cut off a fast bowler - but straight to point",1
25953,8.04E+11,18.1," full and straight  -  too full, in fact - and hayden drives with a crack of the bat to mid-off for a -999",1
25954,8.04E+11,15.6," swept down to short fine leg, and another piece of excellent running between the wickets grabs them another -999",6
25955,8.04E+11,15.5," nudged to the leg side, and another -999 is milked",6
25956,8.04E+11,15.4," ponting skips down the pitch but is almost beaten in the flight, and is saved by bat-padding it -999",6
25957,8.04E+11,15.3," and again it's wide enough for hayden to snick it down to a short third man who, to his credit, is quick to skip across - but ponting is quicker, and sprints through for a -999",6
25958,8.04E+11,15.2," less watchful this time, just angling this to a short third man",6
25959,8.04E+11,15.1," and the big, tall left hander is watchful in defence",6
25960,8.04E+11,7.6," slower ball, and that's good running from the pair, as that -999's nibbled -999 to mid-off with a mere push",4
25961,8.04E+11,7.5," slower ball, outside off, and that -999 finds the fielder at cover",4
25962,8.04E+11,7.4, on leg once more and that's whisked -999 off the hips behind square,4
25963,8.04E+11,7.3," short and that's turned -999 behind square, anderson misfielding on the backward-of-square-leg boundary",4
25964,8.04E+11,7.2," width, and pietersen spares mahmood's blushes by snapping up the ball at cover",4
25965,8.04E+11,7.1, pushed right up there and that's defended down off the back foot into the covers,4
25966,8.04E+11,15.6, excellent slower-ball yorker to complete a successful over,5
25967,8.04E+11,15.5," another low full toss, steered -999 to midwicket",5
25968,8.04E+11,15.5, too far down the leg side. neat take by taylor though,5
25969,8.04E+11,15.4, dobbled onto a good length. zimbabwe are keeping their cool so far,5
25970,8.04E+11,15.3," slow, slow, slow full toss. flintoff's eyes briefly lit up, but it dipped late and he merely turned it square for a -999",5
25971,8.04E+11,15.2, opens the face and steers his first ball down to third man to get off the mark,5
25972,8.04E+11,15.1," -999, a loose full toss, smeared -999 to deep point, and immediately collingwood's looking for -999. he's very quick between the wickets ... but not quick enough. cracking throw from taibu on the boundary's edge, and terrific work from taylor to scoop and whip off the bails. -999 quick wickets, and zimbabwe have a chance to dent the momentum",5
25973,8.04E+11,8.6," comes down again and meets the ball outside off, before driving it back -999 to mid-on",7
25974,8.04E+11,8.5," down, down and a drive to cover this time, collingwood again scampering into the shot",7
25975,8.04E+11,8.4," driven -999 to long-on, collingwood setting off as soon as he hits it",7
25976,8.04E+11,8.3," looking, looking, no as collingwood creeps down and presents a (stuart) broad bat in defence",7
25977,8.04E+11,8.2," down the track, driven to mid-on",7
25978,8.04E+11,8.1, swept to midwicket,7
25979,8.04E+11,5.6," up and over, that went a long way indeed over long-on",14
25980,8.04E+11,5.5, an inside-edged drive to backward square leg,14
25981,8.04E+11,5.4, nudged to cover for a quick -999,14
25982,8.04E+11,5.3," looked to go over the top but holed -999 at cow corner for a well-watched catch, eight yards in from the boundary",14
25983,8.04E+11,5.2, driven to long-off,14
25984,8.04E+11,5.1, a clean strike over long-on into the grass seating area,14
25985,8.04E+11,18.6," just a little bit too short this time. utseya rocks back and has a heave over midwicket. not timed, but reasonably effective in the circumstances",7
25986,8.04E+11,18.5," a short run-up this time from flintoff - a useful trick that - and it's full and straight once again. quality death bowling, but well played too, finding the gap down the ground",7
25987,8.04E+11,18.4," right up in the blockhole once again. another expansive strike, but can't be timed",7
25988,8.04E+11,18.3," full and straight, dug -999 with a swish of the bat, and picked up in the covers",7
25989,8.04E+11,18.2," clubbed -999 to long-on, another jogged -999",7
25990,8.04E+11,18.1," slow yorker, loops down the track and utseya is deceived by the lack of pace",7
25991,8.04E+11,12.6," nudged into the covers and an immediate call. panic stations setting in a bit now, but another run ticked off",3
25992,8.04E+11,12.5," massive appeal for lbw, turned down but that must have been mighty close. meanwhile pietersen is muttering to himself, as well he might. that was dreadful",3
25993,8.04E+11,12.4," dropped, and that's an absolute and total howler from pietersen at mid-off! a horribly mistimed lofted drive, looped into his hands, and straight -999 again ... well, well ...",3
25994,8.04E+11,12.3," on leg stump, flicked off the legs slightly airily, but safe",3
25995,8.04E+11,12.2, drawn forward to yet another good length ball,3
25996,8.04E+11,12.1," cracking control from mascarenhas, and that could be game, set and match for england. a perfect legcutter, taylor - frustrated by the slowing of the run-rate - swings across the line, and his stumps are shattered",3
25997,8.04E+11,10.6," pushed onto the back foot this time, but the same result - no width to work with, and taylor jabs the ball down into the crease. excellent over for england",2
25998,8.04E+11,10.5," lovely length, taylor is drawn forward and defends resolutely",2
25999,8.04E+11,10.4," nurdled into the gap to bring the main man, taylor, back on strike",2
26000,8.04E+11,10.3, full-length and driven into the covers,2
26001,8.04E+11,10.2," that's the breakthrough, and a very timely -999 from england's point of view. mascarenhas dropped it on a length as ever, taibu went for a big swing across the line, and under-edged onto his stumps",2
26002,8.04E+11,10.1, pushed -999 to midwicket for another -999,2
26003,8.04E+11,9.6, poked forward to round off another good over from schofield,5
26004,8.04E+11,9.5, a missed stumping there by prior - taylor's head was raised and he was way -999 of his crease after missing the drive,5
26005,8.04E+11,9.4, pushed off the toes in front of square,5
26006,8.04E+11,9.3, driven -999 straight to long-on for an easy -999,5
26007,8.04E+11,9.2," good loop from schofield, but a patient drive to mid-off",5
26008,8.04E+11,9.1, backs -999 to dig a straight -999 to mid-off,5
26009,8.04E+11,7.6," on leg and some great fielding from anderson, who is as tidy as ever, somehow he caught it and then was able to drag it back in before the momentum carried him over for -999",5
26010,8.04E+11,7.5," outside off, cut right into the ground",5
26011,8.04E+11,7.4, eased into the covers,5
26012,8.04E+11,7.3, driven straight to long-on,5
26013,8.04E+11,7.2," on off, worked off the back foot into the covers",5
26014,8.04E+11,7.1," on off to begin with, cut -999 to cover",5
26015,8.04E+11,4.6," outside off, cut to point and they risk a -999 - a direct shy from maddy at the non-striker's end would have been close",14
26016,8.04E+11,4.5," better, worked into short midwicket for a quick -999",14
26017,8.04E+11,4.4, on middle and leg and with just enough room to pick off his toes and chip deliberately and strongly through midwicket,14
26018,8.04E+11,4.3, a dink-and-run into short midwicket,14
26019,8.04E+11,4.2," up and over, a clever shot, playing with the height and the pace and lifting it off the bottom of the bat very straight behind the -999",14
26020,8.04E+11,4.1," short, gives himself room to chop up and -999 through third man - a diving anderson does his best, but his best isn't good enough here",14
26021,8.04E+11,14.6, driven back to the bowler who dives across to pick the ball up,3
26022,8.04E+11,14.5, down the track and has to readjust at the last minute to cut into the covers,3
26023,8.04E+11,14.4," drags it a touch short, flintoff rocks back and cuts -999 to hodge at deep cover",3
26024,8.04E+11,14.3, driven -999 to mid-on now to bring flintoff back on strike,3
26025,8.04E+11,14.2," another play and a miss, -999 dots all in a row",3
26026,8.04E+11,14.1," on off, good length, shah tries - and misses - the drive",3
26027,8.04E+11,6.6, turned to deep backward square leg,7
26028,8.04E+11,6.5," and that's why ... pietersen plays a classic off drive - test, odi or twenty20, that was a super shot",7
26029,8.04E+11,6.4," johnson swings it across wright who slogs and gets a thick outside edge, gilchrist does the rest",7
26030,8.04E+11,6.3," short, wright shimmies to the off but mistimes and the ball trickles to mid-on",7
26031,8.04E+11,6.2," again he leans back and swings, the ball arcs high over the covers and plops soggily into the outfield",7
26032,8.04E+11,6.1," wide with a bit of bounce and another lean back, heave, and miss",7
26033,8.04E+11,1.6," bat and pad together defensively, and again they settle for a well-run -999 into the off side",8
26034,8.04E+11,1.5," plopped into the covers, soft hands so the ball dribbles no more than ten yards, and that allows a comfortable -999",8
26035,8.04E+11,1.4, wristy flick to backward point who makes a scrambling stop,8
26036,8.04E+11,1.3, a skip down the pitch and prior smashes that for -999 over extra cover ... a shimmy to leg as well and that flew,8
26037,8.04E+11,1.2," on the button, blocked into the leg side but the field are wise to that after -999 singles in the last over and they swoop",8
26038,8.04E+11,1.1," wide, slanted across prior, a swing and a mess and our lipreading expert points -999 he said something very uncouth",8
26039,8.04E+11,12.6," extra loop, outside off now, driven back -999 wide of long-on",13
26040,8.04E+11,12.5," down leg, lapped round the corner through fine leg",13
26041,8.04E+11,12.4, defended on the front foot,13
26042,8.04E+11,12.3," comes down the track, so schofield follows him down leg - stray s too far and ponting sweeps straight, hard and long",13
26043,8.04E+11,12.2," whirrs it in straight, driven to cover",13
26044,8.04E+11,12.1," wide outside off, driven -999 to deep extra cover",13
26045,8.04E+11,5.6," leg-side half volley, picked up and flicked over short fine leg",17
26046,8.04E+11,5.5," fuller, worked to deep midwicket",17
26047,8.04E+11,5.4, a dot ball eases the nerves of the english supporters ... andrew miller was beginning to fret about australia managing 20 an over to eliminate england!,17
26048,8.04E+11,5.3," and again, heaved through midwicket, no grace, maximum effect",17
26049,8.04E+11,5.2," slower ball, this time stroked between mid-off and extra cover ... that was all about timing. the first shot was shrek, that -999 was cinderella",17
26050,8.04E+11,5.1," half volley smacked dismissively back from whence it came, not quite timed as it bounced before it got to the rope",17
26051,8.04E+11,3.6," hayden leans back and tries to hammer the ball through the covers, gets a thick leading edge and it bobbles back to the bowler",6
26052,8.04E+11,3.5, an uppish slash which falls -999 or five yards short of schofield at third man,6
26053,8.04E+11,3.4," another mistimed pull, it hits him on the body and trundles fine on the leg side, broad has a long way to get round the retrieve",6
26054,8.04E+11,3.3," pulled from off stump over midwicket, the ball lands five yards in from the rope and plugs. tiger woods would have been proud of that backspin",6
26055,8.04E+11,3.2, dug in and hayden looks to pull but misses and gets hit on the shoulder for his pains,6
26056,8.04E+11,3.1, full and hayden decides very late to leave the ball and does so with a twirl of the body in the crease,6
26057,8.04E+11,12.6," full delivery, on off, dug -999 towards the bowler",3
26058,8.04E+11,12.5," connects this time, but not convincingly, with the drive to short midwicket",3
26059,8.04E+11,12.4," good short ball again, similar to the other -999 earlier this over, boucher steps back and tries to hook - but isn't too close to the ball",3
26060,8.04E+11,12.3," low full toss, driven -999 straight to long-off and only -999 run is available",3
26061,8.04E+11,12.2," good bouncer, nipping in off the seam and rising through unexpectedly",3
26062,8.04E+11,12.1, short and gets -999 with it as the batsman can only pick -999 point with the back-foot drive,3
26063,8.04E+11,10.6, steps -999 to make room and driven up to wide mid-off,9
26064,8.04E+11,10.5," not so lovely cricket, schofield dragging short again and a big hoick of a mistimed pull whooshes up short of long-on",9
26065,8.04E+11,10.4," drags it a touch short, cut -999 - a tad too late on the shot - to point",9
26066,8.04E+11,10.3," down the track, and driven on the move to mid-on",9
26067,8.04E+11,10.2, driven -999 to long-off,9
26068,8.04E+11,10.1," smashed, just smashed, off the back foot through point sending the dancers into a frenzy",9
26069,8.04E+11,9.6, and to make snape feel better kemp launches that over midwicket for the first -999,12
26070,8.04E+11,9.5, dropped flicked to midwicket where wright drops it a foot or so off the ground diving to his left,12
26071,8.04E+11,9.4," dropped swatted to deep midwicket, anderson steaming in gets there but can't hold the chance",12
26072,8.04E+11,9.3," long hop, mown to long-off ... 'horribly' adds jenny",12
26073,8.04E+11,9.2, on drive past a diving wide mid-on,12
26074,8.04E+11,9.1," pushed into the off side, between the close fielders but no second even though there should have been",12
26075,8.04E+11,8.6, slightly too short but boucher can't capitalise and hits the ball back to a happy schofield,2
26076,8.04E+11,8.5, steps back and mistimed drive back to the bowler,2
26077,8.04E+11,8.4, driven into the leg side but not into a gap,2
26078,8.04E+11,8.4," swept from leg stump, not middled ... not even hit ... and the ball bobbles to short fine leg",2
26079,8.04E+11,8.3," much the same, well bowled",2
26080,8.04E+11,8.2," floated, gentle drive to short extra cover",2
26081,8.04E+11,8.1, kemp winds up and drives a half volley to long-off,2
26082,8.04E+11,4.6," slower ball, de villiers misses, broad start to run for the ball as it bobbles into the leg side, decides to appeal and falls over mid-pitch in the confusion",10
26083,8.04E+11,4.5," half volley and driven through extra cover, a lovely stroke and he really middled that ... he couldn;t have asked for broad to give him -999 more in the slot",10
26084,8.04E+11,4.4, another flashing drive but nowhere near the ball,10
